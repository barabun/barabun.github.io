      This book was significantly improved by the technical review and feedback of many of my friends and colleagues. I'm indebted to them for taking the time to read early versions of the manuscript and provide thoughtful insights and suggestions. Thank you, Paul Strauss, Eric Gregory, Rycharde Hawkes, Nick Long, James Chalfant, Brett Levin, Marcus Marr, Jim Humelsine, and Geoff Levner.

      My passion for good application programming interface design has been developed by working with many great software engineers and managers. Working at several different organizations, I've been exposed to a range of design perspectives, software development philosophies, and problem-solving approaches. Throughout these varied experiences, I've had the privilege to work alongside and learn from many uniquely talented individuals, including:

      I would especially like to acknowledge the great impact that Dr. Yvan G. Leclerc has made on my life from my early years at SRI International. Yvan was my first manager and a true friend. He taught me how to be a good manager of people, how to be a rigorous scientist and engineer, and at the same time how to enjoy life to its fullest. It is a great tragedy that incredible individuals such as Yvan are taken from us too soon.

      Many thanks must also go to Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann Publishers for all their work reviewing, copy editing, typesetting, and publishing this book. This work would quite literally not exist without their backing and energy. Specifically, I want to acknowledge the contribution of Todd Green, Robyn Day, André Cuello, and Melissa Revell for the first edition, as well as Chris Katsaropoulos, Palak Gupta, Prasanna Kalyanaraman, and Gregory Harris for the second edition.

      Most importantly, I'd like to thank my wife, Genevieve Vidanes, for supporting and tolerating me while I spent many hours intently focused on a computer screen. Writing a book can be a big disruption to personal and family life, but she encouraged me throughout the process while also knowing exactly when to make me pause and take a break. Thank you, Genevieve, for your constant love and support. I couldn't do any of this without you on my side.
