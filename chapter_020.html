         Well-written documentation is a critical element of any application programming interface (API). It describes what an API does and how it behaves, such as defining units for parameters, error conditions, or thrown exceptions. For behavior-only API changes, documentation is the only way to communicate a change to the API. This chapter provides a checklist for what you should document and details the various types of documentation you can produce, including automated API documentation, overview documentation, code samples, tutorials, release notes, and license information. A large part of this chapter is dedicated to the use of the Doxygen tool to create API documentation automatically, including sample templates for overview, file, class, method, and enum comments.

       In the very first chapter of this book, I defined an application programming interface (API) as one or more header files plus supporting documentation. In fact, I claim that an API is incompletely specified unless it includes accompanying documentation. This is because header files do not specify the behavior of the API, only the calling conventions for the various functions and methods. David L. Parnas stated this well (

         Reuse is something that is far easier to say than to do. Doing it requires both good design and very good documentation. Even when we see good design, which is still infrequently, we won't see the components reused without good documentation.

       Well-written documentation is therefore a critical element of your API. Accordingly, I am dedicating an entire chapter to this topic. I will start by covering some of the reasons why you should care about documentation, and then describe the various types of documentation that you could provide along with several tools that can be used to aid the task of writing documentation.
      </p>
      <p class="text" id="p0020">
       One of the easiest ways to document your API is to use a tool that automatically extracts comments from your header files and builds API documentation for you. One of the most popular and full featured of these tools is Doxygen, from Dimitri van Heesch. I will therefore spend some time looking at how you can use Doxygen in your projects and provide some sample templates for documenting various elements of your API.
      </p>
      <p class="text" id="p0025">
       Documenting your implementation code is good practice, too, but that documentation is for your own internal use, whereas the need to document your API header files is more vital because that documentation is for your users.
      </p>
      <p class="text" id="p0030">
       I feel obliged to admit at this point that most of the source code examples in this book have little or no comments or documentation. This was done simply to keep these examples as minimal and focused as possible, both to make them easier to digest by you, the reader, and so the book doesn't grow to twice its current size. As a compromise, I've ensured that the source code examples that accompany this book are all well-documented, as should any API headers that you write, too.

        I hope I don't need to convince you that providing your users with details on how to use your API is a good thing. It's certainly true that if you follow the core principles from the Qualities chapter, then your interfaces should already be consistent, discoverable, and easy to use. However, that's not a replacement for good documentation. Professionally

        written documentation is an equally important component of delivering high-quality, world-class APIs. In fact, good documentation can make the difference between a user adopting your API or looking for an alternative.

         Defining behavior
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0040">
         An API is a functional specification. That is, it should define how to use an interface as well as how the interface should behave. Simply looking at a method in a header file will tell you the number and types of its arguments and the type of its return value, but it says nothing about how that method will behave. To illustrate this point, consider this definition of a class that represents an RGB color:
        </p>
        <div>
         <div class="pageavoid">
          <figure class="fig" id="f0025">

        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0045">
         This class definition fully specifies the arguments and return types for each method, so you can write code that creates instances of this class and call each method. However, several things are unknown about the behavior of this class. For example:
        </p>
        <div>
         <ol id="ulist0010">
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0050">

          <li class="bulllist" id="p0055">

           <span class="inlinecode">
            Set()
           </span>
           method? Will it leave them as is, clamp them, take the modulus of the values, or attempt to scale them into the valid range?
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0060">
           <a id="u0020">

           <span class="inlinecode">
            Set()
           </span>
           method? Presumably it's red, green, and then blue, but this hasn't been explicitly documented in the function signatures.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0065">
         The subsequent updated version of this class provides some documentation in the form of comments, to help clarify these points. The triple slash comment style will be explained later in the chapter when I talk more about Doxygen:

         These comments are quite minimal, but nonetheless they specify the behavior of the API to a sufficient degree for a client to use it. Documentation doesn't have to be long-winded to be thorough. Although more details will be appreciated by your users, minimal documentation is better than none at all.

         It's good practice to write these kinds of comments as you're writing the header file itself. You can always go back and add more content or revise the details once the API is more stable and is approaching release quality. But if you do run out of time and need to get the API out the door quickly, you will at least have some basic level of documentation. Even better, you should explicitly schedule a task to write the documentation for your API before it is released.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0080">
         You may even consider creating commit hooks (also known as triggers) for your revision control system to reject new public API code that doesn't include documentation. If that's too draconian a policy, you can still perform the code checks but treat them as advisory feedback rather than roadblocks to checking in new code.

         Documenting the interface's contract
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0085">
         The term design by contract was introduced by Bertrand Meyer as an approach to defining formal specifications for software components (
         <a href="../B9780443222191160015/References_583-587_B9780443222191160015.xhtml#bib65" id="bib_65">
          Meyer, 1987
         </a>
         ). Meyer later trademarked the term in the United States, so many developers now refer to it as contract programming instead. The central notion is that a software component provides a contract, or obligation, for the services that it will provide, and that by using the component a client agrees to the terms of that contract. This concept is founded upon Hoare logic, a formal system developed by Tony Hoare for reasoning about the correctness of programs (
         <a href="../B9780443222191160015/References_583-587_B9780443222191160015.xhtml#bib39" id="bib_39">
          Hoare, 1969
         </a>
         ). The main principles of this model are threefold:
        </p>
        <div>
         <ul class="ce_list" id="olist0010">
          <li class="numlist" id="p0090">
           <a id="o0010">
           </a>
           1.
           <b>
            Preconditions
           </b>
           : the client is obligated to meet a function's required preconditions before calling a function. If the preconditions are not met, then the function may not operate correctly.
          </li>
          <li class="numlist" id="p0095">
           <a id="o0015">

           2.
           <b>
            Postconditions
           </b>
           : the function guarantees that certain conditions will be met after it's finished its work. If a postcondition is not met, then the function did not complete its work correctly.
          </li>
          <li class="numlist" id="p0100">
           <a id="o0020">
           </a>
           3.
           <b>
            Class invariant
           </b>
           : these are constraints that every instance of the class must satisfy. This defines the state that must hold true for the class to operate according to its design.

        <p class="text" id="p0105">
         The best way to specify the details of a contract is in the class and function documentation for your API. In other words, your functions should specify any expected preconditions that must be in force before calling them, as well as any resulting postconditions that will be met after they've completed. Also, your class documentation should specify any invariants that will hold true during the observable lifetime of each class (i.e., after construction, before destruction, and before and after each public method call). Let's look at a couple of examples to demonstrate this concept more concretely.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0110">
         A square root function will have the precondition that the input number must be a positive number, or zero. It will have a postcondition that the result of the function squared should equal the input number (within an appropriate tolerance). These conditions can be documented using Doxygen syntax, as follows (in the next chapter on testing, I'll talk about how you can enforce these conditions in code):

         To give a more object-oriented example, consider a string container class. This has a class invariant that the length of the string, as returned by the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          size()
         </span>
         method, must always be zero or greater. Also, the pointers returned by
         <span class="inlinecode">
          c_str()

         and

         In terms of inheritance relationships between classes, Ken Pugh notes that the preconditions for derived classes can be weaker, but not stronger, than those in its base classes (
         <a href="../B9780443222191160015/References_583-587_B9780443222191160015.xhtml#bib79" id="bib_79">
          Pugh, 2006

         ). That is, a derived class should handle all cases that its base classes handle, but it may decide to handle additional cases by requiring fewer preconditions.

         By contrast, a derived class should inherit all postconditions from its base classes. That is, a function in a derived class must meet all of its base class postconditions as well as the further postconditions that it defines itself.

         Communicating behavioral changes
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0125">
         There are many cases in which an API change doesn't involve changes to any class definitions or function signatures. This happens when you change the underlying implementation for a function without affecting its interface. From a code perspective, this change will be invisible to your clients because it doesn't affect the function signatures in your header files. However, the API has indeed changed because its behavior has changed. In other words, the update will be source and binary compatible, but not functionally compatible.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0130">
         In this case, you can communicate the change by modifying the documentation for the API call. For example, consider this function that returns a list of children in a hierarchy of nodes:

         What to document
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0150">
         You should document every public element of your API: every class, function, enum, constant, and typedef. If your clients can access it, you should tell them what it is and how they can use it (
         <a href="../B9780443222191160015/References_583-587_B9780443222191160015.xhtml#bib11" id="bib_11">
          Bloch, 2008
         </a>
         ). In particular, you should focus on any important aspects that will help them to use your classes and methods productively. This includes describing the behavior of methods as well as their relationship to the rest of the API.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0155">
         Specifying the units of parameters and return values is another particularly important element of good documentation. When doing so, you should consider whether you need to define the nature, accuracy, and precision of the values, too. A particularly pertinent example is that of a timer class that calls client code every
         <i>
          n
         </i>
         seconds. You may document the units of the timeout to be seconds, but it would still be reasonable for a client to ask:
        </p>
        <div>
         <ol id="ulist0015">
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0160">
           <a id="u0025">
           </a>
           ▪ Does time refer to real-world (wall clock) time or process time?
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0165">
           <a id="u0030">
           </a>
           ▪ What's the accuracy of the timer?
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0170">
           <a id="u0035">
           </a>
           ▪ Will other API operations affect the accuracy of the timer or block it?
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0175">
           <a id="u0040">
           </a>
           ▪ Will the timer drift over time or will it always fire relative to the start time?
          </li>
         </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0180">
         Defining these additional characteristics will help your users work out whether the class is appropriate for their tasks. For example, an idle task that just needs to perform some trivial work roughly every second doesn't care whether it gets woken up after 1.0
         <span title='hsp="0.25"'>
         </span>
         s or 1.1
         <span title='hsp="0.25"'>
         </span>
         s. However, an analog clock that increments its second hand on every invocation would soon show the wrong time under the same conditions.

         In addition to this list of API behaviors, Diomidis Spinellis developed a short list of qualities for which all good code documentation should strive (
         <a href="../B9780443222191160015/References_583-587_B9780443222191160015.xhtml#bib90" id="bib_90">

         It's also good practice to have another person review your documentation. As the developer who wrote the code, you are often too close to the problem space and may assume knowledge that the normal user will not have. As Michi Henning puts it, the developer of the API is “mentally contaminated by the implementation” (
         <a href="../B9780443222191160015/References_583-587_B9780443222191160015.xhtml#bib38" id="bib_38">

         ). Therefore, have a fellow developer, quality assurance (QA) engineer, or technical writer look over your API documentation and be open to the feedback from that fresh perspective.

        Types of documentation
       </h2>
       <p class="textfl" id="p0310">
        There are various types of documentation you can provide for your API. Not all of these will be appropriate for every project, but it's worth being aware of the various options that your users may expect.
       </p>
       <p class="text" id="p0315">
        Moreover, many software products provide documentation that can accept contributions from users. This may be via the use of a wiki, in which any user can create and edit documentation, such as the massive World of Warcraft wiki at
        <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/">
         https://wowpedia.fandom.com/
        </a>
        or Web pages that support user comment addendums, such as the PHP manual at
        <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/">
         http://www.php.net/manual/
        </a>
        . This is obviously a very powerful capability that can build a community around your API and create collective documentation that goes beyond what you could achieve on your own. Even if you don't employ an automated system for user contributions, you should provide a way for them to send feedback to you so that it can be incorporated into the documentation manually.
       </p>
       <p class="text" id="p0320">
        Much of the documentation that you (or your users) write will apply to specific versions of the API. One trap that's easy to fall into with wiki-based solutions is that the wiki content will eventually refer to a range of versions of the API. It's worth considering how you can create distinct versioned sets of documentation, perhaps generating a separate copy of the documentation for each major release. This will allow clients who are using older versions to view the documentation for that specific release, while letting you keep the latest documentation focused on the current version of the API.

        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0330">
         The most obvious kind of documentation for an API is the type that's automatically generated from comments in your source code. This allows you to keep the documentation for classes and methods right next to their declaration in the header files. The result is that you're more likely to keep the documentation up-to-date when you change the API. It's also easy to generate the latest documentation for a new release, and this documentation can have cross-references between related functionalities of the API.

         It's perhaps obvious, but any user documentation comments should appear in your public headers, not
         <span class="inlinecode">
          .cpp
         </span>
         files, so that they're more readily discoverable by your users. This is particularly important for closed source APIs, in which users don't have access to your
         <span class="inlinecode">
          .cpp

         These source code comments are often maintained by developers. However, the quality of your API documentation can be greatly enhanced if you have professional technical writers perform a pass over the comments for style, grammar, and consistency checks. Also, as a fresh set of eyes, these writers can often provide good feedback and suggest additional information to highlight or improve examples to include. Some technical writers may not feel comfortable changing source code directly, but in those cases they can easily mark up a hard copy of the documentation and let the developer make the actual code changes.

        <p class="text" id="p0345">
         There are several tools that let you create API documentation from comments in your C++ source code. These can normally generate output in various formats, such as

         Overview documentation
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0395">
         In addition to autogenerated API documentation, you should have manually written prose that provides higher-level information about the API. This will normally include an overview of what the API does and why the user should care about it. In a large organization, this task is normally performed by a technical writer. It may even be localized into several different languages. The overview documentation will often cover these topics:
        </p>
        <div>
         <ol id="ulist0030">
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0400">
           <a id="u0180">
           </a>
           • A high-level conceptual view of the API: what problem is being solved and how the API works. Diagrams are great if they are appropriate.
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0405">
           <a id="u0185">
           </a>
           • The key concepts, features, and terminology.
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0410">
           <a id="u0190">
           </a>
           • System requirements for using the API.
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0415">
           <a id="u0195">
           </a>
           • How to download, install, and configure the software.
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0420">
           <a id="u0200">
           </a>
           • How to provide feedback or report bugs.
          </li>
          <li class="bulllist" id="p0425">
           <a id="u0205">
           </a>
           • A statement on the life cycle stage of the API (e.g., prerelease, maintenance, stability, or deprecated; see the Versioning chapter).
          </li>
         </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0430">
         There can also be opportunities to write custom scripts that make calls to your API or parse data files (or even parts of source code files) so that they can insert richer information into your overview documentation. For example, imagine an image processing API that provides several image filtering objects, each holding a name, a description, and a set of parameters. You could write a script to extract each filter object from the API and generate a simple markdown table in your overview documentation. That way, users have easy access to key information about the features of your API.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0435">
         In the past, I've supported this kind of capability by writing documentation that embeds HTML comments to indicate the start and end of a section that will be updated by a script. (Most markdown systems can parse HTML comments but won't show them in the rendering of the documentation.) Then I've written a script that loads the
         <a id="p426">
         </a>
         <span aria-label="426" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagebreak_426" role="doc-pagebreak">
         </span>
         markdown file, finds the special start and end comments, and inserts the autogenerated content between them. For example, the file may originally look like:
        </p>
        <div>
         <div class="pageavoid">
          <figure class="fig" id="f0065">
           <img alt="image" height="334" src="../../IMAGES/B9780443222191000155/main.assets/u11-09-9780443222191.jpg" width="1907"/>
           <figcaption class="figleg">
           </figcaption>
          </figure>
         </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0440">
         and after running the script, the file may look like:
        </p>
        <div>
         <div class="pageavoid">
          <figure class="fig" id="f0070">
           <img alt="image" height="524" src="../../IMAGES/B9780443222191000155/main.assets/u11-10-9780443222191.jpg" width="2476"/>
           <figcaption class="figleg">
           </figcaption>
          </figure>
         </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0445">
         This way, you can generate rich overview documentation that provides your clients with useful information about your API. Because these sections of your documentation are autogenerated, all you need to do is rerun your script and your documentation will instantly be up-to-date with your code.

        <p class="textfl" id="p0450">
         Examples are really, really important. An API overview is often too high-level to allow users to glean how to use your API, and even though you have documentation for every class and method in your API, this doesn't immediately tell the user how to use the API to perform a task. Adding even a few small examples can greatly enhance the utility of your documentation. Remember that an API is software for other developers. They just want to know how they can use your interface to get their job done. This can be part of a Getting Started section in your documentation and may include any of these:

            FAQs.
           </b>
           A set of answers to frequently asked questions can be a very helpful addition to your documentation set. It lets your users quickly and easily discover whether the API suits their needs, how to avoid common pitfalls, or how to solve typical problems.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="text" id="p0485">
         The act of writing documentation forces you to think from the user's perspective. As such, it can help you to identify shortcomings in the API or areas that could be simplified. It's therefore good practice to write the skeleton for the high-level documentation and some initial example code early on, to force you to think more deeply about the overall design and the use cases of your library.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0490">
         Automation can also be useful here. For example, your sample code can be taken from your corpus of unit tests. That way, you guarantee that your code samples always compile and run successfully. You can then have a script that copies the relevant test code from your repository and embeds it into your documentation. This can use the same technique as earlier with special start/end comments in the markdown files to indicate where to insert the code. Again, this provides the benefit that your documentation is always up-to-date with your latest working code.

         You should always specify the license under which you're distributing your API. This lets your clients know what rights you are granting them and what their obligations are. Generally, you will use a license from one of these two categories:

Often these software products are closed source and require a licensing fee (although as a counterexample, the Qt commercial license includes the source code). Proprietary licenses may restrict certain activities such as reverse engineering the software, the number of users or machines, the number of developers, or concurrent use of the software by multiple users.

Software that conforms to this category is referred to as free and open source software, commonly abbreviated to FOSS or FLOSS (free, libre, open source software).

        ). This suggests that providing more documentation sometimes can be detrimental because your users may miss the really important points and caveats because they are buried too deeply. The use of higher-level tutorials and example code can help to address this problem. Also, cross-references between related classes and methods can lead the user to discover features about which they were unaware. Some researchers have also suggested using word clouds or other variable-font techniques to highlight important or common classes (

         Inclusive language
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0665">
         There has been a conscious move in recent years across the software engineering field to try to use more respectful and inclusive language. One high-profile example is when GitHub changed its default branch name for newly created repositories from master to main, to avoid racially charged associations.

         Your software and its documentation will likely be used by a broad range of users from a diverse set of backgrounds and cultures. You may therefore want to consider the terminology and phrasing you use to ensure that they convey the concepts you intended in a positive and welcoming manner. It's important to appreciate that it's not your intent that matters, but the potential impact of your words on the users of your software or documentation.

        <p class="text" id="p0675">
         One simple way to achieve this is to prefer more neutral terms where possible. This table lists common software terms that may be considered insensitive today, and some suggestions for more inclusive alternatives.

         Many organizations have writing style guides that provide recommendations on how to write inclusively and respectfully. A common theme across many of these documents is to imagine how your content might be interpreted from different perspectives. For example, will your word choices be understood by all of your users, and do those words carry any harmful or negative associations? The following list offers some areas to consider when naming concepts in your software and when writing the associated documentation:

           <b>
            Color:
           </b>
           Avoid using color to convey positive or negative qualities, such as using white as a label for good and black for bad. Also avoid words such as nonwhite that imply white is the default.

           <b>
            Race:
           </b>
           Avoid using words that reinforce racial or ethnic stereotypes. More generally, simply avoid referring to race unless it's relevant to your software project. You may also want to prefer terms such as built-in instead of native.

            Gender:
           </b>
           When the context doesn't require a specific gender, you can use gender-neutral pronouns such as they, their, or them, or use the plural form (e.g., “Users can enter their passwords here”).

        Using Doxygen
       </h2>
       <p class="textfl" id="p0745">
        Doxygen is a utility to generate API documentation automatically in various formats based upon the comments that you write in your source code. It has support for many languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, Java, Python, Fortran, C#, and PHP, and it can generate output in several formats, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, XML, RTF, and Unix man pages, among others.
       </p>
       <p class="text" id="p0750">
        Doxygen is open source (released under the GNU GPL) and binaries are provided for several platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. It's been developed since 1997 and is now a mature and powerful system. Because it's a popular tool and is used on many projects, I've dedicated the rest of this chapter to covering the basics of how you can use Doxygen in your own projects. However, similar guidelines apply to any of the other tools that I listed earlier in the Automated API documentation section.

         The configuration file
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0760">
         Doxygen is highly configurable, with over 200 options in recent versions. All of these options can be specified via the Doxygen configuration file. This is an ASCII text file with a simple
         <span class="inlinecode">
          key = value
         </span>
         format. You can generate a default configuration file by running Doxygen with the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          -g
         </span>
         command line argument.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0765">
         You will then want to edit this configuration file to specify some details about your source code and to change the default behavior in certain cases. Some of the entries I find that I change a lot are:

          HTML_OUTPUT

         setting). In the following sections I'll describe how you can add comments to your code that Doxygen will pick up and add to this generated documentation.

         You must use a special comment style to signal to Doxygen that you wish to add the comment text to the API documentation. There are various comment styles that Doxygen supports, including:

         Which style you adopt is a matter of personal taste: they all behave the same. I will adopt the triple slash style (///) for the rest of this chapter.

         Within a comment, there are several commands you can specify to provide specific information to Doxygen. This information will often be formatted specially in the resulting documentation. The next list summarizes some of the most useful commands (refer to the Doxygen manual for the complete list):

         API comments
        </h3>
        <p class="textfl" id="p0895">
         Doxygen allows you to specify overview documentation for your entire API using the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          \mainpage
         </span>
         comment. This lets you provide a high-level description of the API as well as a breakdown of the major classes. This description will appear on the front page of the documentation that Doxygen produces. It's common to store these comments in a separate file, such as
         <span class="inlinecode">
          overview.dox
         </span>
         (this requires updating the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          FILE_PATTERNS
         </span>
         entry of the Doxygen configuration file to include
         <span class="inlinecode">
          ∗.dox
         </span>
         ).
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0900">
         The text in this overview documentation may be long enough justify breaking it into separate sections. In that case, you can use the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          \section
         </span>
         and
         <span class="inlinecode">
          \subsection
         </span>
         commands to introduce this structure. You can even create separate pages to contain more detailed descriptions for certain parts of your API. This can be done with the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          \page
         </span>
         command.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="p0905">
         You may also find it useful to define groups of behavior for your API so that you can break up the various classes in your API into different categories. For example, you could create groups for classes or files pertaining to file handling, container classes, logging, versioning, and so forth. This is done by declaring a group with
         <span class="inlinecode">
          \defgroup
         </span>
         and then using the
         <span class="inlinecode">
          \ingroup
         </span>
         to add any specific element to that group.

        <p class="text" id="p0910">
         Putting these features together, the next comment provides overview documentation for an entire API, which is broken down into three sections and cross-references two additional pages for more detailed descriptions. The pages include a link to show all of the API elements that have been tagged as part of a given group:

         You can provide documentation for individual methods, detailing the name and a description for each parameter (and optionally if they are in, out, or in/out parameters) as well as a description of the return value. As with the class sample template, you may also consider adding
         <span class="inlinecode">

         </span>
         or
         <span class="inlinecode">

         , as appropriate:

         If you have methods in a class that fall into one or more logical groupings, you can specify this to Doxygen so that it will group the related methods together under a named subsection. This can be used to provide a more appropriate ordering of the class members, instead of Doxygen's default behavior. The next code snippet demonstrates the specification of two such member groups:

         Doxygen also lets you provide comments for enums, including documentation for individual values in the enum. The latter can be done using Doxygen's ‘&lt;’ comment syntax, which attaches the documentation to the previous element, instead of the next element:
