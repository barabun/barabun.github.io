      uses an approach to C++ programming that will both increase the quality of your code and improve your programming efficiency. You will find discussions on new C++23 features throughout this sixth edition. These features are not just isolated to a few chapters or sections; instead, examples have been updated to use new features when appropriate.

      teaches you more than just the syntax and language features of C++. It also emphasizes programming methodologies, reusable design patterns, and good programming style. The
      <i class="calibre18">

      </i>
      methodology incorporates the entire software development process, from designing and writing code to debugging and working in groups. This approach will enable you to master the C++ language and its idiosyncrasies, as well as take advantage of its powerful capabilities for large-scale software development.

      Imagine users who have learned all of the syntax of C++ without seeing a single example of its use. They know just enough to be dangerous! Without examples, they might assume that all code should go in the
      <code class="calibre21">
       main()
      </code>
      function of the program or that all variables should be global—practices that are generally not considered hallmarks of good programming.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre13" id="fintro-para-0011">
      Professional C++ programmers understand the correct way to use the language, in addition to the syntax. They recognize the importance of good design, the theories of object-oriented programming, and the best ways to use existing libraries. They have also developed an arsenal of useful code and reusable ideas.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre13" id="fintro-para-0012">
      By reading and understanding this book, you will become a professional C++ programmer. You will expand your knowledge of C++ to cover lesser known and often misunderstood language features. You will gain an appreciation for object-oriented design and acquire top-notch debugging skills. Perhaps most important, you will finish this book armed with a wealth of reusable ideas that you can actually apply to your daily work.

      There are many good reasons to make the effort to be a professional C++ programmer as opposed to a programmer who knows C++. Understanding the true workings of the language will improve the quality of your code. Learning about different programming methodologies and processes will help you to work better with your team. Discovering reusable libraries and common design patterns will improve your daily efficiency and help you stop reinventing the wheel. All of these lessons will make you a better programmer and a more valuable employee. While this book can't guarantee you a promotion, it certainly won't hurt.
