      CHAPTER 34: DEVELOPING CROSS-PLATFORM AND CROSS-LANGUAGE APPLICATIONS
     </h2>

      Few programmers submit résumés that list only a single language or technology, and few large applications rely on only a single language or technology. Even if you're only interviewing for a C++ position, the interviewer may still ask questions about other languages, especially as they relate to C++.

        The ways in which platforms can differ (architecture, integer sizes, and so on)

       <li class="calibre9" id="bapp01-li-0217">
        The fact that you should try to find a cross-platform library to accomplish a certain task, instead of starting to implement the functionality yourself for different kinds of platforms

        The fact that C++ can interoperate with other languages, such as C#, Java, scripting languages, and so on

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0126">
       The most popular cross-language question is to compare and contrast two different languages. You should avoid saying only positive or negative things about a particular language, even if you really love or hate that language. The interviewer wants to know that you are able to see trade-offs and make decisions based on them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0127">
       Cross-platform questions are more likely to be asked while discussing previous work. If your résumé indicates that you once wrote C++ applications that ran on a custom hardware platform, you should be prepared to talk about the compiler you used and the challenges of that platform.
