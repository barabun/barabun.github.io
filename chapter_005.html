      Even if you have used the language for years, you might still be unfamiliar with the more advanced features of C++, or you might not be using the full capabilities of the language. Maybe you don't yet know all the new features introduced with the latest release, C++23. Perhaps you write competent C++ code but would like to learn more about design and good programming style in C++. Or maybe you're relatively new to C++ but want to learn the “right” way to program from the start. This book will meet those needs and bring your C++ skills to the professional level.

      Because this book focuses on advancing from basic or intermediate knowledge of C++ to becoming a professional C++ programmer, it assumes that you have some knowledge about programming.

      , “A Crash Course in C++ and the Standard Library,” covers the basics of C++ as a refresher, but it is not a substitute for actual training in programming. If you are just starting with C++ but you have experience in another programming language such as C, Java, or C#, you should be able to pick up most of what you need from

      In any case, you should have a solid foundation in programming fundamentals. You should know about loops, functions, and variables. You should know how to structure a program, and you should be familiar with fundamental techniques such as recursion. You should have some knowledge of common data structures such as queues, and useful algorithms such as sorting and searching. You don't need to know about object-oriented programming just yet—that is covered in

      , “Designing with Classes.”

      You will also need to be familiar with the compiler you will be using to compile your code. Two compilers, Microsoft Visual C++ and GCC, are introduced later in this introduction. For other compilers, refer to the documentation that came with your compiler.
