      CHAPTER 15: OVERLOADING C++ OPERATORS
     </h2>
     <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0075">
      It's possible, though somewhat unlikely, that you will have to perform something more difficult than a simple operator overload during an interview. Some interviewers like to have an advanced question on hand that they don't really expect anybody to answer correctly. The intricacies of operator overloading make great, nearly impossible questions because few programmers get the syntax right without looking it up. That means it's a great area to review before an interview.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0077">
       It's impossible to predict the exact questions that you'll get, but the number of operators is finite. As long as you've seen an example of overloading each operator that makes sense to overload, you'll do fine!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0078">
       One possible question is to write a simple class, for instance, a
       <code class="calibre21">
        Fraction
       </code>
       class to store mathematical fractions. The interviewer might then ask you to add support for some operators such as addition and subtraction. If you're unsure how to add or subtract fractions, ask the interviewer as that's not the point of the question; the point is writing overloaded operators.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0079">
       Besides asking you to implement an overloaded operator, you could be asked high-level questions about operator overloading. A find-the-bug question could contain an operator that is overloaded to do something that is conceptually wrong for that particular operator. In addition to syntax, keep the use cases and theory of operator overloading in mind.

      CHAPTERS 16–20 AND 25: THE STANDARD LIBRARY
     </h2>
     <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0080">
      As you've seen, certain aspects of the Standard Library can be difficult to work with. Few interviewers would expect you to recite the details of Standard Library classes unless you claim to be a Standard Library expert. If you know that the job you're interviewing for makes heavy use of the Standard Library, you might want to write some Standard Library code the day before to refresh your memory. Otherwise, recalling the high-level design of the Standard Library and its basic usage should suffice.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0082">
       If interviewers are dead set on asking detailed Standard Library questions, there really are no bounds to the types of questions they could ask. If you're feeling uncertain about syntax, though, you should state the obvious during the interview: “In real life, of course, I'd look that up in
       <i class="calibre18">
        Professional C++
       </i>
       , but I'm pretty sure it works like this …” At least that way, the interviewer is reminded that he should forgive the details, as long as you get the basic idea right.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0083">
       High-level questions about the Standard Library are often used to gauge how much you've used the Standard Library without making you recall all the details. For example, casual users of the Standard Library may be familiar with associative and non-associative containers. A slightly more advanced user would be able to define an iterator, describe how iterators work with containers, and describe the remove-erase idiom. Other high-level questions could ask you about your experience with Standard Library algorithms, or whether you've customized the Standard Library. An interviewer might also gauge your knowledge about function objects and lambda expressions, and their use with Standard Library algorithms. When talking about lambda expressions, you can score extra points if you explain the use of the
       <code class="calibre21">
        auto
       </code>
       keyword to define generic lambda expressions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre13" id="bapp01-para-0084">
       You might also be asked to explain the benefits of using the ranges library. Remember, it basically allows you to write code that describes
       <i class="calibre18">
        what
       </i>
       you want to do instead of
       <i class="calibre18">
        how
       </i>
       you want to do it.
