      Reading this book will surely give your C++ career a kick-start, but employers will want you to prove yourself before they offer the big bucks. Interview methodologies vary from company to company, yet many aspects of technical interviews are predictable. A thorough interviewer will want to test your basic coding skills, your debugging skills, your design and style skills, and your problem-solving skills. The set of questions you might be asked is quite large. In this appendix, you'll read about some of the different types of questions you may encounter and the best tactics for landing that high-paying C++ programming job you're after.

     <p id="bapp01-para-0003">
      This appendix iterates through all chapters of the book, discussing the aspects of each chapter that are likely to come up in an interview situation. Each section also includes a discussion of the types of questions that could be designed to test those skills, and the best ways to deal with those questions.

     </h2>
     <p id="bapp01-para-0004">
      A technical interview will often include some basic C++ questions to weed out the candidates who put C++ on their résumé simply because they've heard of the language. These questions might be asked during a
      <i>
       phone screen
      </i>
      , when a developer or recruiter calls you before bringing you in for an in-person interview. They could also be asked via e-mail or in person. When answering these questions, remember that the interviewer is just trying to establish that you've actually learned and used C++. You generally don't need to get every detail right to earn high marks.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0006">
       Basic C++ questions will often come in the form of a vocabulary test. The interviewer may ask you to define C++ terms, such as
       <code>
        auto
       </code>
       or
       <code>
        enum class
       </code>
       . She may be looking for the textbook answer, but you can often score extra points by giving sample usage or extra detail. For example, when asked to define the
       <code>
        auto
       </code>
       keyword, you can score extra points by not only explaining the use of
       <code>
        auto
       </code>
       to define variables, but also its use with function return type deduction and structured bindings.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0007">
       The other form that basic C++ competence questions can take is a short program that you write in front of the interviewer. An interviewer may give you a warm-up question, such as, “Write
       <i>
        Hello, World
       </i>
       in C++.” When you get a seemingly simple question like this, make sure that you score all the extra points you can by showing that you are namespace-savvy and up-to-date with the latest standards; i.e., you use the modern
       <code>
        std::print()
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        println()
       </code>
       functions instead of the C-style
       <code>
        printf()
       </code>
       function, and you know that a single import of
       <code>
        std
       </code>
       gives access to the entire Standard Library. However, upgrading a code base with every new C++ standard takes time, so a lot of companies don't always use the latest C++ standard. That means you still need to know how to do things using older standards. For the “Hello, World” program, you should also demonstrate that you can write it using
       <code>
        std::cout
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        #include
       </code>
       instead of
       <code>
        std::println()
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        import
       </code>
       .
      </p>

       </span>
       Asking a candidate to define
       <code>
        const
       </code>
       is a classic C++ interview question. The keyword provides a sliding scale with which an interviewer can assess an answer. For example, a fair candidate will talk about
       <code>
        const
       </code>
       variables. A good candidate will explain
       <code>
        const
       </code>
       member functions and pass-by-reference-to-
       <code>
        const
       </code>
       and explain why this can be more efficient than pass-by-value. A great candidate might talk about the relationship of
       <code>
        const
       </code>
       to thread-safety (discussed in
       <a href="c27.xhtml">
        Chapter 27
       </a>
       , “Multithreaded Programming with C++”), show how to define
       <code>
        static const
       </code>
       data members (discussed in
       <a href="c09.xhtml">
        Chapter 9
       </a>
       , “Mastering Classes and Objects”), or differentiate
       <code>
        const
       </code>
       from
       <code>
        constexpr
       </code>
       (see
       <a href="c09.xhtml">
        Chapter 9
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain topics described in this chapter also come in find-the-bug type problems. Be on the lookout for misuse of references. For example, imagine a class that contains a reference as a data member:
      </p>
      <pre id="bapp01-code-0001"><code>class Gwenyth</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    private:</code>
<code>        int&amp; m_caversham;</code>
<code>};</code>
<code>int main()</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    Gwenyth g;</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       The statement in
       <code>
        main()
       </code>
       won't compile, and the compiler will spit out an error saying that it attempts to reference a deleted function. Because
       <code>
        m_caversham
       </code>
       is a reference, it needs to be bound to a variable when the class is constructed. The compiler-generated default constructor cannot do that, so the compiler implicitly deletes the default constructor of
       <code>
        Gwenyth
       </code>
       . You need to provide a constructor and initialize the reference in the constructor initializer. The class could take the variable to be referenced as a parameter to the constructor:
      </p>
      <pre id="bapp01-code-0002"><code>class Gwenyth</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    public:</code>
<code>        explicit <b>Gwenyth(int&amp; i) : m_caversham { i } { }</b></code>
<code>    private:</code>
<code>        int&amp; m_caversham;</code>
<code>};</code></pre>

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0013">
       An interviewer could ask you to explain how you can append two strings together. With this question, the interviewer wants to find out whether you are thinking as a C++ programmer or as a C programmer. If you get such a question, you should explain the
       <code>
        std::string
       </code>
       class and show how to use it to append two strings. It's also worth mentioning that the
       <code>
        string
       </code>
       class handles all memory management for you automatically, and contrasting this to C-style strings.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0014">
       Most interviewers won't ask specific details about localization. If you do receive a question about your experience with localization, be sure to mention the importance of considering worldwide use from the beginning of the project.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0015">
       You might also be asked about the general idea behind locales and facets. Most likely, you will not have to explain the exact syntax, but you should explain that they allow you to format text and numbers according to the rules of a certain language or country.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0016">
       You might get a question about Unicode, but almost certainly it will be a question to explain the ideas and the basic concepts behind Unicode instead of implementation details. So, make sure you understand the high-level concepts of Unicode and that you can explain their use in the context of localization. You should also know about the different options for encoding Unicode characters, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, without specific details.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0017">
       As discussed in
       <a href="c21.xhtml">
        Chapter 21
       </a>
       , regular expressions can have a daunting syntax. It is unlikely that an interviewer will ask you about little details of regular expressions. However, you should be able to explain the concept of regular expressions and what kind of string manipulations you can do with them.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0020">
       Style questions can come in a few different forms. A friend of mine was once asked to write the code for a relatively complex algorithm on a whiteboard. As soon as he wrote the first variable name, the interviewer stopped him and told him he passed. The question wasn't about the algorithm; it was just a red herring to see how well he named his variables.

       You need to be careful when a potential employer asks you to submit a code sample. You probably cannot legally submit code that you wrote for a previous employer. You also have to find a piece of code that shows off your skills without requiring too much background knowledge. For example, you wouldn't want to submit your master's thesis on high-speed image rendering to a company that is interviewing you for a database administration position. If the company gives you a specific program to write, that's a perfect opportunity to show off what you've learned in this book. If the potential employer doesn't specify the program, you could consider writing a small program specifically to submit to the company. Instead of selecting some code you've already written, start from scratch to produce code that is relevant to the job and highlights good style.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0027">
       Design questions are hard for an interviewer to come up with; any program that you could design in an interview setting is probably too simple to demonstrate real-world design skills. Design questions may come in a fuzzier form, such as “Tell me the steps in designing a good program” or “Explain the fundamental rule of code reuse.” They can also be less explicit. When discussing your previous job, the interviewer may ask, “Can you explain the design of that project to me?” Be careful not to expose intellectual property from your previous jobs, though.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0028">
       If the interviewer is asking you about a specific library, he will probably focus on the high-level aspects of the library as opposed to technical specifics. For example, you may be asked to explain what the strengths and weaknesses of the Standard Library are from a library design point of view. The best candidates talk about the Standard Library's breadth and standardization as strengths and its sometimes-complex usage as a drawback.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0029">
       You may also be asked a design question that initially doesn't sound as if it's related to libraries. For example, the interviewer could ask how you would go about creating an application that downloads MP3 music from the web and plays it on a local computer. This question isn't explicitly related to libraries, but that's what it's getting at; the question is really asking about process.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0030">
       You should begin by talking about how you would gather requirements and do initial prototypes. Because the question mentions two specific technologies, the interviewer would like to know how you would deal with them. This is where libraries come into play. If you tell the interviewer that you would write your own web classes and MP3-playing code, you won't fail the test, but you will be challenged to justify the time and expense of reinventing these tools.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0031">
       <span aria-label="1245" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1245" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       A better answer is to say that you would survey existing libraries that perform web and MP3 functionality to see if one exists that suits the project. You might want to name some technologies that you would start with, such as libcurl (
       <code>
        curl.haxx.se
       </code>
       ) for web retrieval in Linux or the Windows Media library for music playback in Windows.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0032">
       Mentioning some websites with free libraries, and some ideas of what those websites provide, might also get you extra points. Some examples are
       <code>
        <a href="http://codeguru.com">
         codeguru.com
        </a>
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        <a href="http://codeproject.com">
         codeproject.com
        </a>
       </code>
       for Windows libraries,
       <code>
        <a href="http://boost.org">
         boost.org
        </a>
       </code>
       and

        <a href="http://github.com">
         github.com
        </a>
       </code>
       for platform-independent C++ libraries, and so on. Giving examples of some of the licenses that are available for open-source software, such as the GNU General Public License, Boost Software License, Creative Commons license, MIT license, OpenBSD license, and so on, might score you extra credit.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0035">
       There are typically two ways to ask object-oriented design questions: you can be asked to define an object-oriented concept, or you can be asked to sketch out an object-oriented hierarchy. The former is pretty straightforward. Remember that examples might earn you extra credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're asked to sketch out an object-oriented hierarchy, the interviewer will usually provide a simple application, such as a card game, for which you should design a class hierarchy. Interviewers often ask design questions about games because those are applications with which most people are already familiar. They also help lighten the mood a bit when compared to questions about things like database implementations. The hierarchy you generate will, of course, vary based on the game or application they are asking you to design. Here are some points to consider:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="bapp01-list-0006">
       <li id="bapp01-li-0054">
        The interviewer wants to see your thought process. It is very important to think aloud, brainstorm, and engage the interviewer in a discussion. Don't be afraid to erase and go in a different direction!
       </li>
       <li id="bapp01-li-0055">
        The interviewer may assume that you are familiar with the application. If you've never heard of blackjack and you get a question about it, ask the interviewer to clarify or change the question.
       </li>
       <li id="bapp01-li-0056">
        <span aria-label="1246" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1246" role="doc-pagebreak">
        </span>
        Unless the interviewer gives you a specific format to use when describing the hierarchy, it's recommended that your class diagrams take the form of inheritance trees with rough lists of member functions and data members for each class.
       </li>
       <li id="bapp01-li-0057">
        You may have to defend your design or revise it to take added requirements into consideration. Try to gauge whether the interviewer sees actual flaws in your design, or whether she just wants to put you on the defensive to see your skills of persuasion.

      CHAPTER 6: DESIGNING FOR REUSE
     </h2>
     <p id="bapp01-para-0037">
      Interviewers rarely ask questions about designing reusable code. This omission is unfortunate because having programmers on staff who can write only single-purpose code can be detrimental to a programming organization. Occasionally, you'll find a company that is savvy on code reuse and asks about it in their interviews. Such a question is an indication that it might be a good company to work for.

       Questions about reuse will almost certainly be about previous projects on which you have worked. For example, if you worked at a company that produced both consumer and professional video-editing applications, the interviewer may ask how code was shared between the two applications. Even if you aren't explicitly asked about code reuse, you might be able to sneak it in. When you're describing some of your past work, tell the interviewer if the modules you wrote were used in other projects. Even when answering apparently straight coding questions, make sure to consider and mention the interfaces involved. As always, be careful not to expose intellectual property from your previous jobs, though.

      CHAPTER 7: MEMORY MANAGEMENT
     </h2>
     <p id="bapp01-para-0041">
      You can be sure that an interviewer will ask you some questions related to memory management, including your knowledge of smart pointers. Besides smart pointers, you will also get more low-level questions. The goal is to determine whether the object-oriented aspects of C++ have distanced you too much from the underlying implementation details. Memory management questions will give you a chance to prove that you know what's really going on.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0048">
       Questions such as “What does the keyword
       <code>
        mutable
       </code>
       mean?” are great for phone screening. A recruiter may have a list of C++ terms and will move candidates to the next stage of the process based on the number of terms that they get right. You might not know all of the terms thrown at you, but keep in mind that other candidates are facing the same questions, and it's one of the few metrics available to a recruiter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The find-the-bug style of questions is popular among interviewers and course instructors alike. You will be presented with some nonsense code and asked to point out its flaws. Interviewers struggle to find quantitative ways to analyze candidates, and this is one of the few ways to do it. In general, your approach should be to read each line of code and voice your concerns, brainstorming aloud. The types of bugs can fall into several categories:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="bapp01-list-0010">
       <li id="bapp01-li-0099">
        <b>
         Syntax errors:
        </b>
        These are rare; interviewers know you can find compile-time bugs with a compiler.
       </li>
       <li id="bapp01-li-0100">
        <b>
         Memory problems:
        </b>
        These include problems such as leaks and double deletion.
       </li>
       <li id="bapp01-li-0101">
        <b>
         “You wouldn't do that” problems:
        </b>
        This category includes things that are technically correct but are not recommended. For example, you wouldn't use C-style character arrays; you would use
        <code>
         std::string
        </code>
        instead.
       </li>
       <li id="bapp01-li-0102">
        <b>
         Style errors:
        </b>
        Even if the interviewer doesn't count it as a bug, point out poor comments or variable names.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Here's a find-the-bug problem that demonstrates each of these areas:

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0055">
       Many of the pitfalls in inheritance questions are related to getting the details right. When you are writing a base class, don't forget to make the member functions
       <code>
        virtual
       </code>
       . If you mark all member functions
       <code>
        virtual
       </code>
       , be prepared to justify that decision. You should be able to explain what
       <code>
        virtual
       </code>
       means and how it works. Also, don't forget the
       <code>
        public
       </code>
       keyword before the name of the parent class in the derived class definition (for example,
       <code>
        class Derived : public Base
       </code>
       ). It's unlikely that you'll be asked to perform nonpublic inheritance during an interview.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0056">
       More challenging inheritance questions have to do with the relationship between a base class and a derived class. Be sure you know how the different access levels work, especially the difference between
       <code>
        private
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        protected
       </code>
       . Remind yourself of the phenomenon known as
       <i>
        slicing
       </i>
       , when certain types of casts cause a class to lose its derived class information.

      As one of the most arcane parts of C++, templates are a good way for interviewers to separate the C++ novices from the pros. While most interviewers will forgive you for not remembering some of the advanced template syntax, you should go into an interview knowing the basics.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0063">
       Many interview questions start out with a simple problem and gradually add complexity. Often, interviewers have an endless amount of complexity that they are prepared to add, and they simply want to see how far you get. For example, an interviewer might begin a problem by asking you to create a class that provides sequential access to a fixed number of
       <code>
        int
       </code>
       s. Next, the class will need to grow to accommodate an arbitrary number of elements. Then, it will need to work with arbitrary data types, which is where templates come in. From there, the interviewer could take the problem in a number of directions, asking you to use operator overloading to provide array-like syntax or continuing down the template path by asking you to provide a default type for the template type parameters or to put type constraints on them. However, most interviewers understand that the template syntax can be difficult and will forgive you for syntactical errors.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0064">
       The interviewer might ask you high-level questions related to template metaprogramming to find out whether you have heard about it. While explaining, you could give a small example such as calculating the factorial of a number at compile time. Don't worry if the syntax is not entirely correct. As long as you explain what it is supposed to do, you should be fine.

       Be prepared to discuss error handling if the interviewer brings it up. But don't try to shoehorn error handling into the discussion yourself and force the interviewer to talk about it if they're really trying to focus the interview on something else, like data structures or algorithms.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0071">
       Interviewers might ask you about different error handling strategies. Additionally, you might be asked to give a high-level overview of how stack unwinding works when an exception is thrown, without implementation details.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0072">
       Of course, not all programmers appreciate exceptions. Some may even have a bias against them for performance reasons. If the interviewer asks you to do something without exceptions, you'll have to revert to traditional
       <code>
        nullptr

     <p id="bapp01-para-0075">
      It's possible, though somewhat unlikely, that you will have to perform something more difficult than a simple operator overload during an interview. Some interviewers like to have an advanced question on hand that they don't really expect anybody to answer correctly. The intricacies of operator overloading make great, nearly impossible questions because few programmers get the syntax right without looking it up. That means it's a great area to review before an interview.

       It's impossible to predict the exact questions that you'll get, but the number of operators is finite. As long as you've seen an example of overloading each operator that makes sense to overload, you'll do fine!

      <p id="bapp01-para-0078">
       One possible question is to write a simple class, for instance, a
       <code>
        Fraction
       </code>
       class to store mathematical fractions. The interviewer might then ask you to add support for some operators such as addition and subtraction. If you're unsure how to add or subtract fractions, ask the interviewer as that's not the point of the question; the point is writing overloaded operators.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0079">
       Besides asking you to implement an overloaded operator, you could be asked high-level questions about operator overloading. A find-the-bug question could contain an operator that is overloaded to do something that is conceptually wrong for that particular operator. In addition to syntax, keep the use cases and theory of operator overloading in mind.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0082">
       If interviewers are dead set on asking detailed Standard Library questions, there really are no bounds to the types of questions they could ask. If you're feeling uncertain about syntax, though, you should state the obvious during the interview: “In real life, of course, I'd look that up in
       <i>
        Professional C++
       </i>
       , but I'm pretty sure it works like this …” At least that way, the interviewer is reminded that he should forgive the details, as long as you get the basic idea right.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0083">
       High-level questions about the Standard Library are often used to gauge how much you've used the Standard Library without making you recall all the details. For example, casual users of the Standard Library may be familiar with associative and non-associative containers. A slightly more advanced user would be able to define an iterator, describe how iterators work with containers, and describe the remove-erase idiom. Other high-level questions could ask you about your experience with Standard Library algorithms, or whether you've customized the Standard Library. An interviewer might also gauge your knowledge about function objects and lambda expressions, and their use with Standard Library algorithms. When talking about lambda expressions, you can score extra points if you explain the use of the
       <code>
        auto
       </code>
       keyword to define generic lambda expressions.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0084">
       You might also be asked to explain the benefits of using the ranges library. Remember, it basically allows you to write code that describes
       <i>
        what
       </i>
       you want to do instead of
       <i>
        how

       Instead of asking you any detailed questions about the chrono library, an interviewer might explain a problem involving dates and times and ask you how you would tackle it. If you explain that you would implement your own classes to work with dates and times, be prepared to explain why. A better approach is to explain that you would use the functionality provided by the chrono library. Remember, reuse of code is an important programming paradigm.

Unfortunately, there is a major problem with a question like this: what are the odds that you're going to come up with the same solution that the company did when the problem was actually solved? Because the odds are slim, you need to be extra careful to justify your designs. You might not come up with the actual solution, but you could still have an answer that is correct or even better than the company's newer design.

       An interviewer could ask you to write some tests during the interview, but it's unlikely that a program presented during an interview would contain the depth necessary for interesting tests. It's more likely that you will be asked high-level testing questions. Be prepared to describe how testing was done at your last job and what you liked and didn't like about it. Again, be careful not to disclose any confidential information. After you've answered the interviewer's questions about testing, a good question for you to ask the interviewer is to ask how testing is done at their company.

       During an interview, you might be challenged with an obscure debugging problem. Remember that the process is the most important thing, and the interviewer probably knows that. Even if you don't find the bug during the interview, make sure that the interviewer knows what steps you would go through to track it down. If the interviewer hands you a function and tells you that it crashes during execution, she should award you just as many points or even more if you properly discuss the sequence of steps to find the bug, as if you find the bug right away.

      Because design patterns are popular in the professional world (many candidates even list them as skills), it's likely that you'll encounter an interviewer who wants you to explain a pattern, give a use case for a pattern, or implement a pattern.

      <p id="bapp01-para-0123">
       Answering questions about design patterns is usually a walk in the park, unless the interviewer expects you to know the details of every single pattern known to humankind. Luckily, most interviewers who appreciate design patterns will just want to chat with you about them and get your opinions. After all, looking up concepts in a book or online instead of memorizing them is a good pattern in itself.

      Few programmers submit résumés that list only a single language or technology, and few large applications rely on only a single language or technology. Even if you're only interviewing for a C++ position, the interviewer may still ask questions about other languages, especially as they relate to C++.

       Types of Questions
      </h3>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0126">
       The most popular cross-language question is to compare and contrast two different languages. You should avoid saying only positive or negative things about a particular language, even if you really love or hate that language. The interviewer wants to know that you are able to see trade-offs and make decisions based on them.
      </p>
      <p id="bapp01-para-0127">
       Cross-platform questions are more likely to be asked while discussing previous work. If your résumé indicates that you once wrote C++ applications that ran on a custom hardware platform, you should be prepared to talk about the compiler you used and the challenges of that platform.
