      Your code will contain bugs. Every professional programmer would like to write bug-free code, but the reality is that few software engineers succeed in this endeavor. As computer users know, bugs are endemic in computer software. The software that you write is probably no exception. Therefore, unless you plan to bribe your co-workers into fixing all your bugs, you cannot be a professional C++ programmer without knowing how to debug C++ code. One factor that often distinguishes experienced programmers from novices is their debugging skills.

      THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF DEBUGGING
     </h2>
     <p>
      The first rule of debugging is to be honest with yourself and admit that your code will contain bugs! This realistic assessment enables you to put your best effort into preventing bugs from crawling into your code in the first place, while you simultaneously include the necessary features to make debugging as easy as possible.

      BUG TAXONOMIES
     </h2>
     <p id="c31-para-0010">
      A
      <i>
       bug
      </i>
      in a computer program is incorrect run-time behavior. This undesirable behavior includes both
      <i>
       catastrophic
      </i>
      and
      <i>
       noncatastrophic bugs
      </i>
      . Examples of catastrophic bugs are program crashes, data corruption, operating system failures, or some other horrific outcome. A catastrophic bug can also manifest itself external to the software or computer system running the software; for example, medical software might contain a catastrophic bug causing a massive radiation overdose to a patient. Noncatastrophic bugs are bugs that cause the program to behave incorrectly in more subtle ways; for example, a web browser might return the wrong web page, or a spreadsheet application might calculate the standard deviation of a column incorrectly. These are also called
      <i>
       logical bugs
      </i>
      .
     </p>
     <p id="c31-para-0011">
      There are also
      <i>
       cosmetic bugs
      </i>
      , where something is visually not correct, but otherwise works correctly. For example, a button in a user interface is kept enabled when it shouldn't be—but clicking it does nothing. All computations are perfectly correct, the program does not crash, but it doesn't look as “nice” as it should.
     </p>
     <p id="c31-para-0012">
      The underlying cause, or
      <i>
       root cause
      </i>
      , of a bug is the mistake in the program that causes this incorrect behavior. The process of debugging a program includes both determining the root cause of the bug and fixing the code so that the bug will not occur again.

      AVOID BUGS
     </h2>
     <p>
      It's impossible to write completely bug-free code, so debugging skills are important. However, a few tips can help you to minimize the number of bugs:

     <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0002">
      <li id="c31-li-0006">
       <b>
        Read this book from cover to cover:
       </b>
       Learn the C++ language intimately, especially pointers and memory management. Then, recommend this book to your friends and co-workers so they avoid bugs too.
      </li>
      <li id="c31-li-0007">
       <b>
        Design before you code:
       </b>
       Starting to write code for a feature without thinking about the design at all tends to lead to convoluted designs that are harder to understand and are more
       <span aria-label="1119" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1119" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       error prone. It also makes you more likely to omit possible edge cases and error conditions. Thus, before you start writing code, think about the design. And, once you start the implementation, don't be afraid to change the design if you come across an issue that you didn't think of before. There is nothing wrong with making changes to the design once you start the implementation.
      </li>
      <li id="c31-li-0008">
       <b>
        Do code reviews:
       </b>
       In a professional environment, every single line of code should be peer reviewed. Sometimes it takes a fresh perspective to notice problems.
      </li>
      <li id="c31-li-0009">
       <b>
        Test, test, and test again:

       Thoroughly test your code, and have
       <i>
        others

       test your code! They are more likely to find problems you haven't thought of.

       <b>
        Write automated unit tests:
       </b>
       Unit tests are designed to test isolated functionality. You should write unit tests for all implemented features. Run these unit tests automatically as part of your continuous integration setup, or automatically after each local compilation.

       <b>
        Don't ignore compiler warnings:
       </b>
       Configure your compiler to compile with a high warning level. Do not blindly ignore warnings. Ideally, you should enable an option in your compiler to treat warnings as errors. This forces you to address each warning immediately. With GCC or Clang you can pass
       <code>
        -Werror
       </code>
       to the compiler to treat all warnings as errors. In Visual C++, open the properties of your project, go to Configuration Properties ➪ C/C++ ➪ General, and enable the option Treat Warnings As Errors.

       <b>
        Use static code analysis:
       </b>
       A static code analyzer helps to pinpoint problems in your code by analyzing your source code. Ideally, static code analysis is done in real time while typing code in your integrated development environment (IDE) to detect problems early. It can also be set up to run automatically by your build process. There are quite a few different analyzers available on the Internet, both free and commercial.

       and
       <code>

       Error Logging
      </h3>
      <p id="c31-para-0015">
       Imagine this scenario: You have just released a new version of your flagship product, and one of the first users reports that the program “stopped working.” You attempt to pry more information
       <span aria-label="1120" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1120" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       from the user and eventually discover that the program died in the middle of an operation. The user can't quite remember what he was doing or if there were any error messages. How will you debug this problem?
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0016">
       Now imagine the same scenario, but in addition to the limited information from the user, you are also able to examine the error log on the user's computer. In the log you see a message from your program that says, “Error: unable to open config.xml file.” Looking at the code near the spot where that error message was generated, you find a line in which you read from the file without checking whether the file was opened successfully. You've found the root cause of your bug!
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0017">
       <i>
        Error logging
       </i>
       is the process of writing error messages to persistent storage so that they will be available following an application, or even machine, crash. Despite the example scenario, you might still have doubts about this strategy. Won't it be obvious by your program's behavior if it encounters errors? Won't the user notice if something goes wrong? As the preceding example shows, user reports are not always accurate or complete. In addition, many programs, such as the operating system kernel and long-running daemons like
       <code>
        inetd
       </code>
       (internet service daemon) or
       <code>
        syslogd
       </code>
       on Unix, are not interactive and run unattended on a machine. The only way these programs can communicate with users is through error logging. In many cases, a program might also want to automatically recover from certain errors and hide those errors from the user. Still, having logs of those errors available can be invaluable to improve the overall stability of the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, your program should log errors as it encounters them. That way, if a user reports a bug, you will be able to examine the log files on the machine to see if your program reported any errors prior to encountering the bug. Unfortunately, error logging is platform-dependent: C++ does not contain a standard logging mechanism. Examples of platform-specific logging mechanisms include the
       <code>
        syslog
       </code>
       facility in Unix and the event reporting API in Windows. You should consult the documentation for your development platform. There are also some open-source implementations of cross-platform logging frameworks. Here are two examples:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0003">
       <li id="c31-li-0016">
        log4cpp at
        <code>
         <a href="http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net">
          log4cpp.sourceforge.net
         </a>
        </code>
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0017">

        </code>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c31-para-0019">
       Now that you're convinced that logging is a great feature to add to your programs, you might be tempted to log messages every few lines in your code so that, in the event of any bug, you'll be able to trace the code path that was executing. These types of log messages are appropriately called
       <i>
        traces
       </i>
       .
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0020">
       However, you should not write these traces to log files for two reasons. First, writing to persistent storage is slow. Even on systems that write the logs asynchronously, logging that much information will slow down your program. Second, and most important, most of the information that you would put in your traces is not appropriate for the end user to see. It will just confuse the user, leading to unwarranted service calls. That said, tracing is an important debugging technique under the correct circumstances, as described in the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some specific guidelines for the types of errors you should log:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0004">
       <li id="c31-li-0018">
        Unrecoverable errors, such as a system call failing unexpectedly.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0019">
        Errors for which an administrator can take action, such as low memory, an incorrectly formatted data file, an inability to write to disk, or a network connection being down.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0020">
        <span aria-label="1121" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1121" role="doc-pagebreak">
        </span>
        Unexpected errors such as a code path that you never expected to take or variables with unexpected values. On the other hand, your code should “expect” users to enter invalid data and should handle it appropriately. An unexpected error represents a bug in your program.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0021">
        Potential security breaches, such as a network connection attempted from an unauthorized address, or too many network connections attempted (denial of service).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c31-para-0022">
       A natural question you might be asking yourself is: What should be included in a logged error? At the very least, each logged error should contain the date and time the error occurred and the error message itself. In multithreaded applications, it's useful to log the ID of the thread that caused the error as well. Starting with C++23, the Standard Library includes
       <code>
        std::stacktrace
       </code>
       , discussed in
       <a href="c14.xhtml">
        Chapter 14
       </a>
       , which allows you to get a stack trace at any moment during the execution of your program. You could include such a stack trace, or at least part of it, with each logged error.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0023">
       It is also useful to log warnings, or recoverable errors, giving you the option to investigate if they can possibly be avoided.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0024">
       Most logging APIs allow you to specify a
       <i>
        log level
       </i>
       or
       <i>
        error level
       </i>
       , typically at least “error,” “warning,” or “info”. You can log non-error conditions under a log level that is less severe than “error.” For example, you might want to log significant state changes in your application, or startup and shutdown of the program. You also might consider giving your users a way to adjust the log level of your program at run time so that they can customize the amount of logging that occurs.

       Debug Traces
      </h3>
      <p>
       When debugging complicated problems, public error messages generally do not contain enough information. You often need a complete trace of the code path taken, or values of variables before the bug showed up. In addition to basic messages, it's sometimes helpful to include the following information in debug traces:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0005">
       <li id="c31-li-0022">
        The thread ID, if it's a multithreaded program
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0023">
        The name of the function that generates the trace
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0024">
        The name of the source file in which that function lives
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You can add this tracing to your program through a special
       <i>
        debug mode
       </i>
       , or via a
       <i>
        ring buffer
       </i>
       . Both of these techniques are explained in detail in the following sections. Note that in multithreaded programs you have to make your trace logging thread-safe. See
       <a href="c27.xhtml">
        Chapter 27
       </a>
       , “Multithreaded Programming with C++,” for details on multithreaded programming.

       <p id="c31-para-0028">
        A first technique to add debug traces is to provide a debug mode for your program. In debug mode, the program writes trace output to standard error or to a file, and perhaps does extra checking during execution. There are several ways to add a debug mode to your program. All following examples are writing traces in text format.

        <p id="c31-para-0029">
         Start-time debug mode allows your application to run with or without debug mode depending on a command-line argument. This strategy includes the debug code in the “release” binary and allows debug mode to be enabled at a customer site. However, it does require users to restart the program to run it in debug mode, which may prevent you from obtaining useful information about certain bugs.

         The following example is a simple program implementing a start-time debug mode. This program doesn't do anything useful; it is only for demonstrating the technique.

         All logging functionality is wrapped in a
         <code>
          Logger
         </code>
         class. This class has two
         <code>
          static
         </code>
         data members: the name of the log file and a Boolean saying whether logging is enabled or disabled. The class has a public
         <code>
          static log()
         </code>
         member function template. Variadic templates like this one are discussed in
         <a href="c26.xhtml">
          Chapter 26
         </a>
         , “Advanced Templates.” The log file is opened, flushed, and closed on each call to
         <code>
          log()
         </code>
         . This might lower performance a bit; however, it does guarantee correct logging, which is more important.

         The following helper macro is defined to make it easy to log something. It's a macro accepting a variable number of arguments. You get access to those arguments using
         <code>
          __VA_ARGS__
         </code>
         . The macro
         <span aria-label="1123" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1123" role="doc-pagebreak">

         uses
         <code>
          __func__

         This macro replaces every call to
         <code>
          LOG()

         in your code with a call to
         <code>
          Logger::log()
         </code>
         . The macro automatically includes the function name as first argument to
         <code>
          Logger::log()
         </code>
         . For example, suppose you call the macro as follows:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0003"><code>LOG("The value is: ", value);</code></pre>
        <p>
         The
         <code>
          LOG()
         </code>
         macro replaces this with the following:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0004"><code>Logger::log(__func__, "(): ", "The value is: ", value);</code></pre>
        <p>
         Start-time debug mode needs to parse the command-line arguments to find out whether it should enable debug mode. Unfortunately, there is no standard functionality in C++ for parsing command-line arguments. This program uses a simple
         <code>
          isDebugSet()
         </code>
         function to check for the debug flag among all the command-line arguments, but a function to parse all command-line arguments would need to be more sophisticated.

         <code>
          operator&lt;&lt;

         to write instances of them to a stream. The

         Instead of enabling or disabling debug mode through a command-line argument, you could also use a preprocessor symbol such as
         <code>
          DEBUG_MODE
         </code>
         and
         <code>
          #ifdef
         </code>
         s to selectively compile the debug code into your program. To generate a debug version of this program, you would have to compile it with the symbol
         <code>
          DEBUG_MODE
         </code>
         defined. Your compiler allows you to define symbols during compilation; consult your compiler's documentation for details. For example, GCC allows you to specify
         <code>
          –Dsymbol
         </code>
         through the command line. Microsoft Visual C++ allows you to specify the symbols through the Visual Studio IDE or by specifying
         <code>
          /D symbol
         </code>
         if you use the Visual C++ command-line tools. Instead of using a custom
         <code>
          DEBUG_MODE
         </code>
         symbol, you could also use the
         <code>
          NDEBUG

         symbol, which is defined by a compiler for release builds and not for debug builds.

         The advantage of this technique is that your debug code is not compiled into the “release” binary and so does not increase its size. The disadvantage is that there is no way to enable debugging at a customer site for testing or following the discovery of a bug.

         The most flexible way to provide a debug mode is to allow it to be enabled or disabled at run time. One way to provide this feature is to supply an asynchronous interface that controls debug mode on the fly. This interface could be an asynchronous command that makes an interprocess call into the application (for example, using sockets, signals, or remote procedure calls). This interface could also take the form of a menu command in the user interface. C++ provides no standard way to perform interprocess communication or to implement user interfaces, so an example of this technique is not shown.

       <p id="c31-para-0050">
        Debug mode is useful for debugging reproducible problems and for running tests. However, bugs often appear when the program is running in non-debug mode, and by the time you or the customer enables debug mode, it is too late to gain any information about the bug. One solution to this problem is to enable tracing in your program at all times. You usually need only the most recent traces to debug a program, so you should store only the most recent traces at any point in a program's execution. One way to provide for this is through careful use of log file rotations.
       </p>
       <p id="c31-para-0051">
        However, for performance reasons, it's better that you don't log these traces continuously to disk. Instead, store them in memory and provide a mechanism to dump all the trace messages to standard error or to a log file if the need arises.
       </p>
       <p id="c31-para-0052">
        A common technique is to use a
        <i>

        , or
        <i>
         circular buffer

        , to store a fixed number of messages, or messages in a fixed amount of memory. When the buffer fills up, it starts writing messages at the beginning of the buffer again, overwriting the older messages. This cycle can repeat indefinitely. The following sections provide an implementation of a ring buffer and show you how you can use it in your programs.

         </code>
         class provides a simple ring buffer storing messages. The client specifies the number of entries in the constructor and adds messages with the
         <code>
          addEntry()
         </code>
         member function. Once the number of entries exceeds the number allowed, new entries overwrite the oldest entries in the buffer. The buffer also provides the option to output entries to a stream as they are added to the buffer. The client can specify an output stream in the constructor and can reset it with the
         <code>
          setOutput()
         </code>
         member function. Finally, the
         <code>
          operator&lt;&lt;
         </code>
         streams the entire buffer to an output stream. This implementation uses a variadic template member function, discussed in

         Ring Buffer Implementation
        </h5>
        <p id="c31-para-0054">
         This implementation of the ring buffer stores a fixed number of
         <code>
          string
         </code>
         objects. This approach certainly is not the most efficient solution. Other possibilities would be to provide a fixed number of bytes of memory for the buffer. However, this implementation should be sufficient unless you're writing a high-performance application.
        </p>
        <p id="c31-para-0055">
         For multithreaded programs, it's useful to add the ID of the thread to each trace entry. Of course, the ring buffer has to be made thread-safe before using it in a multithreaded application. See

         Using the Ring Buffer
        </h5>
        <p>
         To use the ring buffer, you can create an instance of it and start adding messages to it. When you want to print the buffer, just use
         <code>
          operator&lt;&lt;
         </code>
         to print it to the appropriate
         <code>

         . Here is the earlier start-time debug mode program modified to use a ring buffer instead. Changes are highlighted. The definitions of the
         <code>

         Storing trace debug messages in memory is a great start, but for them to be useful, you need a way to access these traces for debugging.
        </p>
        <p id="c31-para-0059">
         Your program should provide a “hook” to tell it to export the messages. This hook could be similar to the interface you would use to enable debugging at run time. Additionally, if your program encounters a fatal error that causes it to exit, it could export the ring buffer automatically to a log file before exiting.
        </p>
        <p id="c31-para-0060">
         Another way to retrieve these messages is to obtain a memory dump of the program. Each platform handles memory dumps differently, so you should consult a reference or expert for your platform.

       Assertions allow you to “force” your program to exhibit a bug at the exact point where that bug originates. If you didn't assert at that point, your program might proceed with those incorrect values, and the bug might not show up until much later. Thus, assertions allow you to detect bugs earlier than you otherwise would.

       You could use assertions in your code whenever you are “assuming” something about the state of your variables. For example, if you call a library function that is supposed to return a pointer and claims never to return
       <code>
        nullptr
       </code>
       , throw in an
       <code>
        assert()

       .
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0067">
       However, you should assume as little as possible. For example, if you are writing a library function, don't assert that the parameters are valid. Instead, check the parameters, and return an error code or throw an exception if they are invalid.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0068">
       As a rule, assertions should be used only for cases that are truly problematic and should therefore never be ignored when they occur during development. If you hit an assertion during development, fix it, don't just disable the assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at a couple of examples on how to use
       <code>
        assert()
       </code>
       . Here is a
       <code>
        process()
       </code>
       function that requires three elements in a
       <code>
        vector
       </code>
       passed to the function:
      </p>
      <pre id="c31-code-0015"><code>void process(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; coordinate)</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    assert(coordinate.size() == 3);</code>
<code>    <span class="color3">// …</span></code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       If the
       <code>
        process()
       </code>
       function is called with a
       <code>
        vector
       </code>
       that has less or more elements than three, the assertion fails and generates a message similar to the following (the exact message depends on the compiler that is used):
      </p>
      <pre id="c31-code-0016"><code>Assertion failed: coordinate.size() == 3, file D:\test\test.cpp, line 12</code></pre>
      <p>
       If you want a custom error message, you can use the following trick using the comma operator and a set of extra parentheses:
      </p>
      <pre id="c31-code-0017"><code>assert(<b>("A custom message…",</b> coordinate.size() == 3<b>)</b>);</code></pre>
      <p>
       <span aria-label="1131" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1131" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       The output then will be something as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c31-code-0018"><code>Assertion failed: ("A custom message…", coordinate.size() == 3), file D:\test\test.cpp, line 106</code></pre>
      <p>
       If at some point in your code you want that an assert always fails with a certain error message, you can use the following trick:
      </p>
      <pre id="c31-code-0019"><code>assert(!"This should never happen.");</code></pre>

      DEBUGGING TECHNIQUES

     <p id="c31-para-0082">
      Debugging a program can be incredibly frustrating. However, with a systematic approach it becomes significantly easier. Your first step in trying to debug a program should always be to reproduce the bug. Depending on whether you can reproduce the bug, your subsequent approach will differ. The

       Reproducing Bugs
      </h3>
      <p id="c31-para-0083">
       If you can reproduce a bug consistently, it will be much easier to determine the root cause. Sometimes a bug might be reproducible by Alice but not by Bob. That in itself can be a clue for Alice to find the root cause. Finding the root cause of bugs that are not reproducible is difficult, if not impossible.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0084">
       As a first step to reproduce the bug, run the program on a similar environment (hardware, operating system, and so on) and with the same inputs as the run when the bug first appeared. Be sure to include all inputs, from the program's startup to the time of the bug's appearance. A common mistake is to attempt to reproduce the bug by performing only the triggering action. This technique may not reproduce the bug because the bug might be caused by an entire sequence of actions.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0085">
       For example, if your web browser dies when you request a certain web page, it may be due to memory corruption triggered by that particular request's network address. On the other hand, it may be because your program records all requests in a queue, with space for one million entries, and this entry was number 1,000,001. Starting the program over and sending one request certainly wouldn't trigger the bug in that case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it is impossible to emulate the entire sequence of events that leads to the bug. Perhaps the bug was reported by someone who can't remember everything that she did. Alternatively, maybe the program was running for too long to emulate every input. In that case, do your best to reproduce the bug. It takes some guesswork and can be time-consuming, but effort at this point will save time later in the debugging process. Here are some techniques you can try:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0006">
       <li id="c31-li-0025">
        Repeat the triggering action in the correct environment and with as many inputs as possible similar to the initial report.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0026">
        Do a quick review of the code related to the bug. More often than not, you'll find a likely cause that will guide you in reproducing the problem.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0027">
        Run automated tests that exercise similar functionality. Reproducing bugs is one benefit of automated tests. If it takes 24 hours of testing before the bug shows up, it's preferable to let those tests run on their own rather than spend 24 hours of your time trying to reproduce the bug.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0028">
        If you have the necessary hardware available, running slight variations of tests concurrently on different machines can sometimes save time.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0029">
        Run stress tests that exercise similar functionality. If your program is a web server that died on a particular request, try running as many browsers as possible simultaneously that make that request.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c31-para-0087">
       After you are able to reproduce the bug consistently, you should attempt to find the smallest sequence that triggers the bug. You can start with the minimum sequence, containing only the triggering action, and slowly expand the sequence to cover the entire sequence from startup until the bug is triggered. This will result in the simplest and most efficient test case to reproduce it, which makes it simpler to find the root cause of the problem and easier to verify the fix.

       Debugging Reproducible Bugs
      </h3>
      <p>
       When you can reproduce a bug consistently and efficiently, it's time to figure out the problem in the code that causes the bug. Your goal at this point is to find the exact lines of code that trigger the problem. You can use two different strategies:
      </p>

        <b>
         Use a debugger:
        </b>
        Debuggers allow you to step through the execution of your program and to view the state of memory and the values of variables at various points. They are often indispensable tools for finding the root cause of bugs. When you have access to the source code, you should use a
        <i>
         symbolic debugger
        </i>
        : a debugger that utilizes the variable names, class names, and other symbols in your code. To use a symbolic debugger, you must instruct your compiler to generate debug symbols. Check the documentation of your compiler for details on how to enable symbol generation.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0031">
        <b>
         Log debug messages:
        </b>
        By adding enough debug messages to your program and watching its output when you reproduce the bug, you should be able to pinpoint the exact lines of code where the bug occurs. If you have a debugger at your disposal, adding debug messages is usually not recommended because it requires modifications to the program and can be time-consuming. However, if you have already instrumented your program with debug messages as described earlier, you might be able to find the root cause of your bug by running your program in debug mode while reproducing the bug. Note that bugs sometimes disappear simply when you enable logging because the act of enabling logging can slightly change the timings of your application.

      </ul>

       Debugging Nonreproducible Bugs
      </h3>
      <p>
       Fixing bugs that are not reproducible is significantly more difficult than fixing reproducible bugs. You often have little information and must employ a lot of guesswork. Nevertheless, a few strategies can aid you:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0008">
       <li id="c31-li-0032">
        Try to turn a nonreproducible bug into a reproducible bug. By using educated guesses, you can often determine approximately where the bug lies. It's worthwhile to spend some time trying to reproduce the bug. Once you have a reproducible bug, you can figure out its root cause by using the techniques described earlier.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0033">
        Analyze error logs. This is easy to do if you have instrumented your program with error log generation, as described earlier. You should sift through this information because any errors that were logged directly before the bug occurred are likely to have contributed to the bug itself. If you're lucky (or if you coded your program well), your program will have logged the exact reason for the bug at hand.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0034">
        Obtain and analyze traces. Again, this is easy to do if you have instrumented your program with tracing output, for example, via a ring buffer as described earlier. At the time of the bug's occurrence, you ideally obtained a copy of the traces. These traces should lead you right to the location of the bug in your code.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0035">
        Examine a
        <i>
         crash/memory dump
        </i>
        file, if it exists. Some platforms automatically generate memory dump files of applications that terminate abnormally. On Unix and Linux, these
        <span aria-label="1134" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1134" role="doc-pagebreak">
        </span>
        memory dumps are called
        <i>
         core files
        </i>
        . Each platform provides tools for analyzing these memory dumps. They can, for example, be used to view the stack trace of the application and the contents of its memory before the application died.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0036">
        Inspect the code. Unfortunately, this is often the only strategy to determine the cause of a nonreproducible bug. Surprisingly, it often works. When you examine code, even code that you wrote yourself, with the perspective of the bug that just occurred, you can often find mistakes that you overlooked previously. I don't recommend spending hours staring at your code, but tracing through the code path manually can often lead you directly to the problem.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0037">
        Use a memory-watching tool, such as one of the tools described in the section “
        <a href="#c31-sec-0035">
         Debugging Memory Problems
        </a>
        ,” later in this chapter. Such tools often alert you to memory errors that don't always cause your program to misbehave but could potentially be the cause of the bug in question.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0038">
        File or update a bug report. Even if you can't find the root cause of the bug right away, the report will be a useful record of your attempts if the problem is encountered again.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0039">
        If you are unable to find the root cause of the bug, be sure to add extra logging or tracing so that you will have a better chance next time the bug occurs.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="c31-para-0091">
       Once you have found the root cause of a nonreproducible bug, you should create a reproducible test case and move it to the “reproducible bugs” category. It is important to be able to reproduce a bug before you actually fix it. Otherwise, how will you test the fix? A common mistake when debugging nonreproducible bugs is to fix the wrong problem in the code. Because you can't reproduce the bug, you don't know if you've really fixed it, so you shouldn't be surprised when it shows up again a month later.

       Debugging Regressions
      </h3>

       If a feature contains a
       <i>
        regression

       bug, it means that the feature used to work correctly, but at some point unexpectedly stopped working.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0093">
       A useful debugging technique for investigating regressions is to look at the change log of relevant files. If you know at what time the feature was still working, look at all the change logs since that time. You might notice something suspicious that could lead you to the root cause.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0094">
       Another approach that can save you a lot of time when debugging regressions is to use a binary search approach with older versions of the software (often called
       <i>
        bisecting
       </i>
       ) to try to figure out when it started to go wrong. You can use binaries of older versions if you keep them, or you can revert the source code to an older revision. Once you know when it started to go wrong, inspect the change logs to see what changed at that time. This mechanism is possible only when you can reproduce the bug.

       Debugging Memory Problems
      </h3>
      <p id="c31-para-0095">
       Most catastrophic bugs, such as application crashes, are caused by memory errors. Many non-catastrophic bugs are triggered by memory errors as well. Some memory bugs are obvious. For example, if your program attempts to dereference a null pointer, the default action is to terminate the program. However, nearly every platform enables you to respond to catastrophic errors and take remedial action. The amount of effort you devote to the response depends on the importance of this kind of recovery to your end users. For example, a text editor really needs to make a best attempt to
       <span aria-label="1135" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1135" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       save the modified buffers (possibly under a “recovered” name), while for other programs, users may find the default behavior acceptable, even if it is unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p id="c31-para-0096">
       Some memory bugs are more insidious. If you write past the end of an array in C++, your program will probably not crash at that point. However, if that array was on the stack, you may have written into a different variable or array, changing values that won't show up until later in the program. Alternatively, if the array was on the free store, you could cause memory corruption in the free store, which will cause errors later when you attempt to allocate or free more memory dynamically.

         Memory-access errors don't always cause a crash. They can instead lead to subtle errors, in which the program does not terminate but instead produces erroneous results. Erroneous results can lead to serious consequences, for example, when external devices—such as robotic arms, X-ray machines, radiation treatments, life support systems, and so on—are being controlled by the computer.

         Note that the symptoms discussed here for both memory-freeing and memory-access errors are the default symptoms for release builds of your program. Debug builds will most likely behave differently, and when you run the program inside a debugger, the debugger might break into the code when an error occurs.

        Tips for Debugging Memory Errors
       </h4>
       <p id="c31-para-0128">
        Memory-related bugs often show up in slightly different places in the code each time you run the program. This is usually the case with free store memory corruption. Free store memory corruption is like a time bomb, ready to explode at some attempt to allocate, free, or use memory on the free store. So, when you see a bug that is reproducible but that shows up in slightly different places, you should suspect memory corruption.
       </p>
       <p id="c31-para-0129">
        If you suspect a memory bug, your best option is to use a memory-checking tool for C++. Debuggers often provide options to run the program while checking for memory errors. For example, if you run a debug build of your application in the Microsoft Visual C++ debugger, it will catch almost all types of errors discussed in the previous sections. Additionally, there are some excellent third-party tools such as Purify from Rational Software (now owned by IBM) and Valgrind for Linux (discussed in
        <a href="c07.xhtml">
         Chapter 7
        </a>
        ). Microsoft also provides a free download called
        <i>
         Application Verifier
        </i>
        (Part of the Windows SDK,
        <code>

        ), which can be

        </span>
        used with release builds of your applications in a Windows environment. It is a run-time verification tool to help you find subtle programming errors like the previously discussed memory errors. These debuggers and tools work by interposing their own memory-allocation and -freeing routines to check for any misuse of dynamic memory, such as freeing unallocated memory, dereferencing unallocated memory, or writing off the end of an array.
       </p>
       <p id="c31-para-0130">
        If you don't have a memory-checking tool at your disposal and the normal strategies for debugging are not helping, you may need to resort to code inspection. First, narrow down the part of the code containing the bug. Then, as a general rule, look at all raw pointers. Provided that you work on moderate- to good-quality code, most pointers should already be wrapped in smart pointers. If you do encounter raw pointers, take a closer look at how they are used, because they might be the cause of the error. Here are some more items to look for in your code.

       Debugging Multithreaded Programs
      </h3>
      <p>
       C++ includes a threading support library that provides mechanisms for threading and synchronization between threads. This threading support library is discussed in
       <a href="c27.xhtml">
        Chapter 27
       </a>
       . Multithreaded C++ programs are common, so it is important to think about the special issues involved in debugging a multithreaded program. Bugs in multithreaded programs are often caused by variations in timings in the operating system scheduling and can be difficult to reproduce. Thus, debugging multithreaded programs requires a special set of techniques:
      </p>
      <ul class="check1" id="c31-list-0011">
       <li id="c31-li-0048">
        <b>
         Use a debugger:
        </b>
        A debugger makes it relatively easy to diagnose certain multithreaded problems, for example, deadlocks. When a deadlock appears, break into the debugger and inspect the different threads. You will be able to see which threads are blocked and on which line in the code they are blocked. Combining this with trace logs that show you how you came into the deadlock situation should be enough to fix deadlocks.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0049">
        <b>
         Use log-based debugging:
        </b>
        When debugging multithreaded programs, log-based debugging can sometimes be more effective than using a debugger to debug certain problems. You can add log statements to your program before and after critical sections, and before acquiring and after releasing locks. Log-based debugging is extremely useful in investigating race conditions. However, the act of adding log statements slightly changes run-time timings, which might hide the bug.
       </li>
       <li id="c31-li-0050">
        <b>
         Insert forced sleeps and context switches:
        </b>
        If you are having trouble consistently reproducing a problem or you have a hunch about the root cause but want to verify it, you can force certain thread-scheduling behavior by making your threads sleep for specific amounts of time.
        <code>
         &lt;thread&gt;
        </code>
        defines
        <code>
         sleep_until()
        </code>
        and
        <code>
         sleep_for()
        </code>
        in the
        <code>
         std::this_thread
        </code>
        namespace, which you can use to sleep. The time to sleep is specified as an
        <code>
         std::time_point
        </code>
        or an
        <code>
         std::duration
        </code>
        respectively, both part of the chrono library discussed in
        <a href="c22.xhtml">
         Chapter 22
        </a>
        , “Date and Time Utilities.” Sleeping for several seconds right before releasing a lock, immediately before signaling a condition variable, or directly before accessing shared data can reveal race conditions that would otherwise go undetected. If this debugging technique reveals the root cause, it must be fixed so that it works correctly after removing these forced sleeps and context switches. Never leave these forced sleeps and context switches in your code! That would be the wrong “fix” for the problem.

       <li id="c31-li-0051">
        <b>
         Perform code review:
        </b>
        Reviewing your thread synchronization code often helps in finding and fixing race conditions. Try to prove over and over that what happened is not possible, until you see how it is. It doesn't hurt to write down these “proofs” in code comments. Also, ask a co-worker to do pair debugging; she might see something you are overlooking.

        The following program asks the user for a filename, constructs an
        <code>
         ArticleCitations

        instance for that file, and passes this instance by value to the
        <code>
         processCitations()
        </code>
        function, which prints out all the information. Passing the instance by value to the function is done for this buggy example. In production code, you should pass by reference-to-
        <code>

         As you can see from the output, the first time the program reads the citations from the file, to count them, it reads them correctly. However, the second time, they are not read correctly; nothing is printed between “readFile(): reading citations” and “readFile(): finished” — why not? One way to delve deeper into this issue is to add some debugging code to check the state of the file stream after each attempt to read a citation:

         It looks like the stream state is good until after the final citation is read for the first time. Because the
         <code>
          paper1.txt
         </code>
         file contains an empty last line, the
         <code>
          while
         </code>
         loop is executed one more time after having read the last citation. In this last loop,
         <code>
          inputFile &gt;&gt; ws
         </code>
         reads the whitespace of the last line, which causes the stream state to become
         <code>
          eof
         </code>
         . Then, the code still tries to read a line using
         <code>
          getline()
         </code>
         , which causes the stream state to become
         <code>

         and
         <code>
          eof
         </code>
         . That is expected. What is not expected is that the stream state remains
         <code>
          fail
         </code>
         after all attempts to read the citations a second time. That doesn't appear to make sense at first: the code uses
         <code>
          seekg()
         </code>
         to seek back to the beginning of the citations before reading them a second time.

         doesn't clear the
         <code>
          fail
         </code>
         state automatically. When in an error state, streams fail to read data correctly, which explains why the stream state is also
         <code>
          fail

         <code>

         When you try to run your program on this file, depending on your version of Linux and your compiler, you might get a crash that looks something like the following:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0050"><code>Enter a file name ("STOP" to stop): <b>paper2.txt</b></code>
<code>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'</code>
<code>  what():  std::bad_alloc</code>
<code>Aborted (core dumped)</code></pre>
        <p>
         The message “core dumped” means that the program crashed. This time you decide to give the debugger a shot. The Gnu Debugger (GDB) is widely available on Unix and Linux platforms. First, you must compile your program with debugging information (
         <code>
          -g
         </code>
         with g++). Then you can launch the program under GDB. Here's an example session using the debugger to find the root cause of this problem. This example assumes your compiled executable is called
         <code>
          buggyprogram
         </code>
         . Text that you have to type is shown in bold.

        <p>
         When the program crashes, the debugger breaks the execution and allows you to poke around in the state of the program at that time. The
         <code>
          backtrace
         </code>
         or
         <code>
          bt
         </code>
         command shows the current stack trace. The last operation is at the top, with frame number zero (#0).
        </p>

        <p>
         When you get a stack trace like this, you should try to find the first stack frame from the top that is in your own code. In this example, this is stack frame #8. From this frame, you can see that there seems to be a problem in the
         <code>
          copy()
         </code>
         member function of
         <code>
          ArticleCitations
         </code>
         . This member function is invoked because
         <code>
          main()
         </code>
         calls
         <code>
          processCitations()
         </code>
         and passes the argument by value, which triggers a call to the copy constructor, which calls
         <code>
          copy()
         </code>
         . Of course, in production code you should pass a reference-to-
         <code>
          const
         </code>
         , but pass-by-value is used in this example of a buggy program. You can tell the debugger to switch to stack frame #8 with the
         <code>
          frame
         </code>
         command, which requires the index of the frame that you want to jump to:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0053"><code>(gdb) <b>frame 8</b></code>
<code>#8  0x00000000004016ea in ArticleCitations::copy (this=0x7fffffffe090, src=…) at ArticleCitations.cpp:39</code>
<code>39    m_citations = new string[m_numCitations];</code></pre>
        <p>
         This output shows that the following line caused a problem:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0054"><code>m_citations = new string[m_numCitations];</code></pre>
        <p>
         Now, you can use the
         <code>
          list
         </code>
         command to show the code in the current stack frame around the offending line:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0055"><code>(gdb) <b>list</b></code>
<code>34    <span class="color3">// Copy the article name, author, etc.</span></code>
<code>35    m_article = src.m_article;</code>
<code>36    <span class="color3">// Copy the number of citations.</span></code>
<span aria-label="1149" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1149" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><code>37    m_numCitations = src.m_numCitations;</code>

<code>40    <span class="color3">// Copy each element of the array.</span></code>
<code>41    for (int i { 0 }; i &lt; m_numCitations; ++i) {</code>
<code>42        m_citations[i] = src.m_citations[i];</code>
<code>43    }</code></pre>
        <p>
         In GDB, you can print values available in the current scope with the
         <code>
          print
         </code>
         command. To find the root cause of the problem, you can try printing some of the variables. The error happens inside the
         <code>
          copy()
         </code>
         member function, so checking the value of the
         <code>
          src
         </code>
         parameter is a good start:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0056"><code>(gdb) <b>print src</b></code>
<code>$1 = (const ArticleCitations &amp;) @0x7fffffffe060: {</code>
<code>  _vptr.ArticleCitations = 0x401fb0 &lt;vtable for ArticleCitations+16&gt;,</code>
<code>  m_article = "Author with no citations", m_citations = 0x000000000000,</code>
<code>  m_numCitations = -1}</code></pre>
        <p>
         A-ha! Here's the problem. This article isn't supposed to have any citations. Why is
         <code>
          m_numCitations
         </code>
         set to the strange value
         <code>
          -1
         </code>
         ? Take another look at the code in
         <code>
          readFile()
         </code>
         for the case where there are no citations. In that case, it looks like
         <code>
          m_numCitations
         </code>
         is erroneously set to
         <code>
          -1
         </code>
         . The fix is easy: you always need to initialize
         <code>
          m_numCitations
         </code>
         to
         <code>
          0
         </code>
         , instead of setting it to
         <code>
          -1
         </code>
         when there are no citations. Another problem is that
         <code>
          readFile()
         </code>
         can be called multiple times on the same
         <code>
          ArticleCitations
         </code>
         object, so you also need to free a previously allocated
         <code>
          m_citations
         </code>
         array. Here is the fixed code:
        </p>
        <pre id="c31-code-0057"><code>void ArticleCitations::readFile(const string&amp; filename)</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    <span class="color3">// Code omitted for brevity.</span></code>
<code> </code>
<code>    <b>delete [] m_citations;</b>  <span class="color3">// Free previously allocated citations.</span></code>
<code>    <b>m_citations = nullptr;</b></code>
<code>    <b>m_numCitations = 0;</b></code>
<code>    if (count != 0) {</code>
<code>        <span class="color3">// Allocate an array of strings to store the citations.</span></code>
<code>        m_citations = new string[count];</code>
<code>        m_numCitations = count;</code>
<code> </code>
<code>        <span class="color3">// Code omitted for brevity.</span></code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>

         As this example shows, bugs don't always show up right away. It often takes a debugger and some persistence to find them.

       You might be inclined to disregard this example as too small to be representative of real debugging. Although the buggy code is not lengthy, many classes that you write will not be much bigger, even in large projects.

      The most important concept in this chapter is the fundamental law of debugging:
      <i>
       avoid bugs when you're coding, but plan for bugs in your code

      . The reality of programming is that bugs will appear. If you've prepared your program properly, with error logging, debug traces, and assertions, then the actual debugging will be significantly easier.

      This chapter also presented specific approaches for debugging bugs. The most important rule when debugging is to reproduce the problem. Then, you can use a symbolic debugger, or log-based debugging, to track down the root cause. Memory errors present particular difficulties and account for the majority of bugs in legacy C++ code. This chapter described various categories of memory bugs and their symptoms and showed examples of debugging errors in a program.

      Debugging is a hard skill to learn. To take your C++ skills to a professional level, you will have to practice debugging a lot.

         Exercise 31-3:
        </b>
        Given the following code snippet:
        <pre id="c31-code-0059"><code>import std;</code>
<code>using namespace std;</code>
<code> </code>
<code><span aria-label="1153" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1153" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>int sum(int* values, int count)</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    int total { 0 };</code>
<code>    for (int i { 0 }; i &lt;= count; ++i) { total += values[i]; }</code>
<code>    return total;</code>
<code>}</code>
<code> </code>
<code>int main()</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    int values[] { 1, 2, 3 };</code>
<code>    int total { sum(values, sizeof(values)) };</code>
<code>    println("{}", total);</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
        <p class="listPara1" id="c31-para-0183">
         It calculates the sum of a set of values. For the values 1, 2, and 3, you expect the sum to be 6; however, when running the code on my machine, the result is -2 for a debug build and some different random number each time I execute a release build, e.g., 920865056, -321371431, and so on. What's going on? Use a symbolic debugger and its step-by-step execution mode to pinpoint the root cause of the wrong result. Consult the documentation of your debugger to learn how to step through individual lines of your code.

        (

         advanced
        </i>
        ) Modify the start-time debug mode example from earlier in this chapter to use
        <code>
         std::source:location
        </code>
        , discussed in
        <a href="c14.xhtml">
         Chapter 14
        </a>
        , to get rid of the old-style
        <code>
         LOG()
        </code>
        macro. This is trickier than it sounds. The problem is that
        <code>
         Logger::log()
        </code>
        is a variadic function template, so you cannot just add a named
        <code>
         source:location
        </code>
        parameter after the variadic parameter pack. One trick is to use a helper class, for example
        <code>
         Log
        </code>
        . The constructor accepts a variadic parameter pack and a
        <code>
         source:location
        </code>
        and forwards the work to
        <code>
         Logger::log()
        </code>
        . The final part of the trick is the following deduction guide; see
