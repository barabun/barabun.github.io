      C++ programs can be compiled to run on a variety of computing platforms, and the language has been rigorously defined to ensure that programming in C++ for one platform is similar to programming in C++ for another. Yet, despite the standardization of the language, platform differences eventually come into play when writing professional-quality programs in C++. Even when development is limited to a particular platform, small differences in compilers can elicit major headaches. This chapter examines the necessary complication of programming in a world with multiple platforms and multiple programming languages.
     </p>
     <p id="c34-para-0006">
      The first part of this chapter surveys the platform-related issues that C++ programmers encounter. A
      <i>
       platform
      </i>
      is the collection of all the details that make up your development and/or run-time system. For example, your platform may be the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 compiler running on Windows 11 on an Intel Core i7 processor. Alternatively, your platform might be the GCC 13.2 compiler running on Linux on a PowerPC processor. Both of these platforms are able to compile and run C++ programs, but there are significant differences between them.

      The second part of this chapter looks at how C++ can interact with other programming languages. While C++ is a general-purpose language, it may not always be the right tool for the job. Through a variety of mechanisms, you can integrate C++ code with other languages that may better serve your needs.

      CROSS-PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT
     </h2>
     <p id="c34-para-0008">
      There are several reasons why the C++ language encounters platform issues. C++ is a high-level language, and the standard does not specify certain low-level details. For example, the layout of an object in memory is unspecified by the standard and left to the compiler
      <a aria-describedby="c34-note-0001" epub:type="noteref" href="#c34-note-0001" id="R_c34-note-0001" role="doc-noteref">
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
      </a>
      . Different compilers can use different memory layouts for objects.
     </p>
     <p id="c34-para-0009">
      C++ also faces the challenge of providing a standard language and a Standard Library without a standard implementation. Varying interpretations of the specification among C++ compiler and library vendors can lead to trouble when moving from one system to another.
     </p>
     <p id="c34-para-0010">
      Finally, C++ is selective in what the language provides as standard. Despite the existence of the Standard Library, programs often need functionality that is not provided by the language or the Standard Library. This functionality generally comes from third-party libraries or the platform itself, and can vary greatly.

       Architecture Issues
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0011">
       The term
       <i>
        architecture
       </i>
       generally refers to the processor, or family of processors, on which a program runs. A standard PC running Windows or Linux generally runs on the x86 or x64 architecture, and older versions of macOS were usually found on the PowerPC architecture. As a high-level language, C++ shields you from the differences between these architectures. For example, a Core i7 processor may have a single instruction that performs the same functionality as six PowerPC instructions. As a C++ programmer, you don't need to know what this difference is or even that it exists. One advantage to using a high-level language is that the compiler takes care of converting your code into the processor's native assembly code format.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0012">
       However, processor differences do sometimes rise up to the level of C++ code. The first one discussed, the size of integers, is important if you are writing cross-platform code. The others you won't face often, unless you are doing particularly low-level work, but still, you should be aware that they exist.

        Size of Integers
       </h4>
       <p id="c34-para-0013">
        The C++ standard does not define the exact size of integer types. The standard just says the following in section [basic.fundamental]:
       </p>
       <blockquote class="extract">
        <p id="c34-para-0015">
         <i>
          There are five standard signed integer types:
         </i>
         <code>
          signed char
         </code>
         <i>
          ,

         <code>
          long int
         </code>
         <i>
          , and
         </i>
         <code>
          long long int
         </code>
         <i>
          . In this list, each type provides at least as much storage as those preceding it in the list.

        <span aria-label="1213" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1213" role="doc-pagebreak">
        </span>
        The standard does give a few additional hints for the size of these types, but never an exact size. The actual size is compiler-dependent. Thus, if you want to write truly cross-platform code, you cannot rely on these types. One of the exercises at the end of this chapter asks you to investigate this further.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0017">
        Besides these core language integer types, the C++ Standard Library does define a number of types that have clearly specified sizes, all defined in the

        namespace in

        Binary Compatibility
       </h4>
       <p id="c34-para-0027">
        As you probably already know, you cannot take a program compiled for a Core i7 computer and run it on a PowerPC-based Mac. These two platforms are not
        <i>
         binary compatible
        </i>
        because their processors do not support the same set of instructions. When you compile a C++ program, your source code is turned into binary instructions that the computer executes. That binary format is defined by the platform, not by the C++ language.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0028">
        One solution to support platforms that are not binary compatible is to build each version separately with a compiler on each target platform.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0029">
        Another solution is
        <i>
         cross-compilation
        </i>
        . When you are using platform X for your development, but you want your program to run on platforms Y and Z, you can use a cross-compiler on your platform X that generates binary code for platforms Y and Z.

        You can also make your program
        <i>
         open source
        </i>
        . When you make your source code available to end users, they can compile it natively on their systems and build a version of the program that is in the correct binary format for their machines. As discussed in
        <a href="c04.xhtml">
         Chapter 4
        </a>
        , “Designing Professional C++ Programs,” open-source software has become increasingly popular. One of the major reasons is that it allows programmers to collaboratively develop software and increase the number of platforms on which it can run.

        Address Sizes
       </h4>
       <p id="c34-para-0031">
        When someone describes an architecture as
        <i>
         64-bit
        </i>
        , they most likely mean that the
        <i>
         address
        </i>
        size is 64 bits, or 8 bytes. In general, a system with a larger address size can handle more memory and might operate more quickly on complex programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because pointers are memory addresses, they are inherently tied to address sizes. Sometimes, programmers are taught that pointers are always 8 bytes, but this is wrong. For example, consider the following code snippet, which outputs the size of a pointer:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0006"><code>int *ptr { nullptr };</code>
<code>println("ptr size is {} bytes", sizeof(ptr));</code></pre>
       <p>
        If this program is compiled and executed on a 32-bit x86 system, the output will be as follows:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0007"><code>ptr size is 4 bytes</code></pre>
       <p>
        If you compile and run it on an x86-64 system, the output will be as follows:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0008"><code>ptr size is 8 bytes</code></pre>
       <p id="c34-para-0035">
        From a programmer's point of view, the upshot of varying pointer sizes is that you cannot equate a pointer with either 4 or 8 bytes. More generally, you need to be aware that most sizes are not prescribed by the C++ standard. The standard only says that a
        <code>
         long
        </code>
        is at least as long as an
        <code>
         int
        </code>
        , which is at least as long as a
        <code>
         short
        </code>
        , and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        The size of a pointer is also not necessarily the same as the size of an integer. For example, on a 64-bit platform, pointers are 64-bit, but integers could be 32-bit. Casting a 64-bit pointer to a 32-bit integer results in losing 32 critical bits! The standard does define an
        <code>
         std::uintptr_t
        </code>
        type alias in
        <code>
         &lt;cstdint&gt;
        </code>
        which is an integer type at least big enough to hold a pointer. The definition of this type is optional according to the standard, but virtually all compilers support it.

        All modern computers store numbers in a binary representation, but the representation of the same number on two platforms may not be identical. This sounds contradictory, but as you'll see, there are two approaches to representing numbers that both make sense.

        Most computers these days are
        <i>
         byte-addressable
        </i>
        , meaning that every byte in memory has a unique memory address. Numeric types in C++ usually occupy multiple bytes. For example, a
        <code>
         short
        </code>
        may occupy 2 bytes. Imagine that your program contains the following line:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0009"><code>short myShort { 513 };</code></pre>
       <p id="c34-para-0040">
        In binary, the number 513 is 0000 0010 0000 0001. This number contains 16 ones and zeros, or 16 bits. Because there are 8 bits in a byte, the computer needs 2 bytes to store the number. Because each individual memory address contains 1 byte, the computer needs to split the number up into multiple bytes. Assuming that a
        <code>
         short
        </code>
        is 2 bytes, the number is split into two parts. The higher part of the number is put into the
        <i>
         high-order byte
        </i>
        , and the lower part of the number is put into the
        <i>
         low-order byte
        </i>
        . In this case, the high-order byte is 0000 0010 and the low-order byte is 0000 0001.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0041">
        Now that the number has been split up into memory-sized parts, the only question that remains is how to store them in memory. Two bytes are needed, but the order of the bytes is underdetermined and, in fact, depends on the architecture of the system in question.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0042">
        One way to represent the number is to put the high-order byte first in memory and the low-order byte next. This strategy is called
        <i>
         big-endian ordering
        </i>
        because the bigger part of the number comes first. PowerPC and SPARC processors use a big-endian approach. Some other processors, such as x86, arrange the bytes in the opposite order, putting the low-order byte first in memory. This approach is called
        <i>
         little-endian ordering
        </i>
        because the smaller part of the number comes first. An architecture may choose one approach or the other, usually based on backward compatibility. For the curious, the terms
        <i>
         big-endian
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         little-endian
        </i>
        predate modern computers by several hundred years. Jonathan Swift coined the terms in his eighteenth-century novel
        <i>
         Gulliver's Travels
        </i>
        to describe the opposing camps of a debate about the proper end on which to break an egg.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0043">
        Regardless of the
        <i>
         endianness
        </i>
        a particular architecture uses, your programs can continue to use numerical values without paying any attention to whether the machine uses big-endian ordering or little-endian ordering. That ordering only comes into play when data moves between architectures. For example, if you are sending binary data across a network, you may need to consider the endianness of the other system. One solution is to use the standard network byte ordering, which is always big-endian. So, before sending data across a network, you convert it to big-endian, and whenever you receive data from a network, you convert it from big-endian to the native endianness of your system.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0044">
        Similarly, if you are writing binary data to a file, you may need to consider what happens when that file is opened on a system with opposite byte ordering.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Standard Library includes the
        <code>
         std::endian

        enumeration, defined in
        <code>
         &lt;bit&gt;
        </code>
        , which can be used to determine whether the current system is a big- or little-endian system. The following code snippet outputs the native byte ordering of your system:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0010"><code>switch (endian::native)</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    case endian::little:</code>
<code>        println("Native ordering is little-endian.");</code>
<code>        break;</code>
<code>    case endian::big:</code>
<code>        println("Native ordering is big-endian.");</code>
<code>        break;</code>

       Implementation Issues
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0046">
       When a C++ compiler is written, it is designed by a human being who attempts to adhere to the C++ standard. Unfortunately, the C++ standard is more than 2,000 pages long and written in a combination of prose, pseudocode, and examples. Two human beings implementing a compiler according to such a standard are unlikely to interpret every piece of prescribed information in the same way or to catch every single edge case. As a result, compilers will have bugs.
      </p>

        Compiler Quirks and Extensions
       </h4>
       <p id="c34-para-0047">
        There is no simple rule for finding or avoiding compiler bugs. The best you can do is to stay up to speed on compiler updates and perhaps subscribe to a mailing list or newsgroup for your compiler. If you suspect that you have encountered a compiler bug, a simple web search for the error message or condition you have witnessed could uncover a workaround or patch.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0048">
        One area that compilers are notorious for having trouble with is language features that are added by recent updates to the standard. Although in recent years, vendors of major compilers are pretty quick in adding support for the latest features.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another issue to be aware of is that compilers often include their own language extensions without making it obvious to the programmer. For example, variable-length stack-based arrays (VLAs) are not part of the C++ language; however, they are part of the C language. Some compilers support both the C and C++ standards and can allow the use of VLAs in C++ code. One such compiler is g++. The following compiles and runs as expected with the g++ compiler:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0011"><code>int i { 4 };</code>
<code>char myStackArray[i];  <span class="color3">// Not a standard language feature!</span></code></pre>
       <p>
        Some compiler extensions may be useful, but if there is a chance that you will switch compilers at some point, you should see if your compiler has a strict mode where it avoids using such extensions. For example, compiling the previous code with the
        <code>
         -pedantic
        </code>
        flag passed to g++ yields the following warning:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0012"><code>warning: ISO C++ forbids variable length array 'myStackArray' [-Wvla]</code></pre>
       <p id="c34-para-0051">
        The C++ specification allows for a certain type of compiler-defined language extension through the
        <code>
         #pragma
        </code>
        mechanism.
        <code>
         #pragma
        </code>
        is a preprocessor directive whose behavior is defined by the implementation. If the implementation does not understand the directive, it ignores it. For example, some compilers allow the programmer to turn compiler warnings off temporarily with
        <code>
         #pragma
        </code>
        .

        Library Implementations
       </h4>
       <p id="c34-para-0052">
        Most likely, your compiler includes an implementation of the C++ Standard Library. Because the Standard Library is written in C++, however, you aren't required to use the implementation that came bundled with your compiler. You could use a third-party Standard Library that, for example, has been optimized for speed, or you could even write your own.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0053">
        Of course, Standard Library implementers face the same problems that compiler writers face: the standard is subject to interpretation. In addition, certain implementations may make tradeoffs that are incompatible with your needs. For example, one implementation may optimize for speed, while another implementation may focus on optimizing for being able to catch misuses at run time.

        Handling Different Implementations
       </h4>
       <p id="c34-para-0055">
        As discussed in the previous sections, not all compilers and Standard Library implementations behave exactly the same. This is something you need to keep in mind when doing cross-platform development. Concretely, as a developer, you are most likely using a single toolchain, that is, a single compiler with a single Standard Library implementation. It's unlikely that you will personally verify all your code changes with all toolchains that your product must build with. The solution:
        <i>
         continuous integration
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         automated testing
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0056">
        You should set up a continuous integration environment that automatically builds all code changes on all toolchains that you need to support. The moment a build breaks on one of the toolchains, the developer who broke the build should automatically be informed.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0057">
        Not all development environments use the same project files to describe all the source files, compiler switches, and so on. If you need to support multiple environments, manually maintaining separate project files for each is a maintenance nightmare. Instead, it's better to a use a single type of project file or single set of build scripts that can then automatically be transformed to concrete project files or concrete build scripts for specific toolchains. One such tool is called
        <i>
         CMake
        </i>
        . The collection of source files, compiler switches, libraries to link with, and so on, are described in CMake configuration files, which also have support for scripting. The CMake tool then automatically generates project files, for example for Visual C++ for development on Windows, or Xcode for development on macOS.
       </p>
       <p id="c34-para-0058">
        Once the continuous integration environment produces a build, automated testing should be triggered for that build. This should run a suite of test scripts on the produced executable to verify its correct behavior. Also in this step, if something goes wrong, the developer should automatically be informed.

       Platform-Specific Features

      <p>
       C++ is a great general-purpose language. Thanks to the Standard Library, the language is packed with so many features that a casual programmer could happily code in C++ for years without going beyond what is built in. However, professional programs require facilities that C++ does not provide. This section lists several important features that are provided by the platform or third-party libraries, not by the C++ language or the C++ Standard Library:

         Graphical user interfaces:
        </b>
        Most commercial programs today run on an operating system that has a graphical user interface, containing such elements as clickable buttons, movable windows, and hierarchical menus. C++, like the C language, has no notion of these elements. To write a graphical application in C++, you can use platform-specific libraries that allow you to draw windows, accept input through the mouse, and perform other graphical tasks. A better option is to use a third-party library, such as wxWidgets (
        <?span Start cssStyle="text-decoration:underline"??>
        <code>
         wxwidgets.org
        </code>
        ), Qt (

        <code>
         qt.io
        </code>
        ), Uno (
        <code>
         platform.uno
        </code>
        ), and many more that provide an abstraction layer for building graphical applications. These libraries often provide support for many different target platforms.

         Networking:

        The Internet has changed the way we write applications. These days, most applications check for updates through the web, and games provide a networked multiplayer mode.

        </span>
        C++ does not provide a mechanism for networking yet, though several standard libraries exist. The most common means of writing networking software is through an abstraction called
        <i>
         sockets
        </i>
        . A socket library implementation can be found on most platforms, and it provides a simple procedure-oriented way to transfer data over a network. Some platforms support a stream-based networking system that operates like I/O streams in C++. There are also third-party networking libraries available that provide a networking abstraction layer. These libraries often support many different target platforms. Choosing a networking library that is IPv-independent would be a better choice than choosing one that only supports IPv4, as IPv6 is already being used.

         OS events and application interaction:

        In pure C++ code, there is little interaction with the surrounding operating system and other applications. The command-line arguments are about all you get in a standard C++ program without platform extensions. For example, operations such as copy and paste (which interact with the operating system's “clipboard”) are not directly supported in C++. You can either use platform-provided libraries or use third-party libraries that support multiple platforms. For example, both wxWidgets and Qt are examples of libraries that abstract the clipboard operations and support multiple platforms.

      For certain types of programs, C++ may not be the best tool for the job. For example, if your Unix program needs to interact closely with the shell environment, you may be better off writing a shell script than a C++ program. If your program performs heavy text processing, you may decide that the Perl language is the way to go. If you need a lot of database interaction, then C# or Java might be a better choice. C# in combination with the WPF framework or the Uno platform might be better suited to write modern graphical user interface applications, and so on. Still, if you do decide to use another language, you sometimes might want to be able to call into C++ code, for example, to perform some computational-expensive operations; or the other way around, you might want to call non-C++ code from C++.

       Mixing C and C++
      </h3>
      <p>
       As you already know, the C++ language is almost a superset of the C language. Most C code can easily be converted to C++, but there are a few things to keep in mind. A handful of C features are not supported by C++; for example, C supports variable-length arrays (VLAs), while C++ does not. Other things to keep in mind are the use of reserved words. In C, for example, the term
       <i>
        class
       </i>
       has no particular meaning. Thus, it could be used as a variable name, as in the following C code:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0013"><code>int class = 1; <span class="color3">// Compiles in C, not C++</span></code>
<code>printf("class is %d\n", class);</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0064">
       This program compiles and runs in C but yields an error when compiled as C++ code. When you translate, or
       <i>
        port
       </i>
       , a program from C to C++, these are the types of errors you will face. Fortunately, the fixes are usually quite simple. In this case, rename the
       <code>
        class
       </code>
       variable to, e.g.,
       <code>
        classID
       </code>
       and the code will compile.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0065">
       On the other hand, every C++ compiler is also a C compiler. There is no reason to compile “C as C++”; you can just compile “C as C”. If your project consists of a mixture of C and C++, you can simply link the C and C++ object files together into the final executable. This ease of incorporating C code in a C++ program comes in handy when you encounter a useful library or legacy code that was written in C. Functions and classes, as you've seen many times in this book, work just fine together. A class member function can call a function, and a function can make use of objects.

       Shifting Paradigms
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0066">
       One of the dangers of mixing C and C++ is that your program may start to lose its object-oriented properties. For example, if your object-oriented web browser is implemented with a procedural networking library, the program will be mixing these two paradigms. Given the importance and quantity of networking tasks in such an application, you might consider writing an
       <i>
        object-oriented wrapper
       </i>
       around the procedural library. A typical design pattern that can be used for this is called the
       <i>

       .

       The
       <code>
        networklib.h
       </code>
       interface is fairly simple and straightforward. However, it is not object-oriented, and a C++ programmer who uses such a library is bound to feel
       <i>
        icky
       </i>
       , to use a technical term. This library isn't organized into a cohesive class. Of course, the authors of the library could have written a better interface, but as the user of a library, you have to accept what you are given. Writing a wrapper is your opportunity to customize the interface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you build an object-oriented wrapper for this library, take a look at how it might be used as-is to gain an understanding of its actual usage. In the following program, the
       <code>
        networklib
       </code>
       library is used to retrieve the web page at
       <code>
        <a href="http://www.example.com/index.html">
         www.example.com/index.html
        </a>
       </code>
       :
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0015"><code>HostHandle* myHost { lookupHostByName("www.example.com") };</code>
<code>ConnectionHandle* myConnection { connectToHost(myHost) };</code>
<code>char* result { retrieveWebPage(myConnection, "/index.html") };</code>
<code> </code>
<code>println("The result is:\n{}", result);</code>
<code> </code>
<code>freeWebPage(result); result = nullptr;</code>
<code>closeConnection(myConnection); myConnection = nullptr;</code>
<code>freeHostHandle(myHost); myHost = nullptr;</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0070">
       A possible way to make the library more object-oriented is to provide a single abstraction that recognizes the commonality between looking up a host, connecting to the host, and retrieving a web page. A good object-oriented wrapper hides the needless complexity of the
       <code>
        HostHandle
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        ConnectionHandle
       </code>
       types.

       This example follows the design principles described in

       <a href="c06.xhtml">
        6
       </a>
       , “Designing for Reuse”: the new class should capture the common use case for the library. The previous example shows the most frequently used pattern: first a host is looked up, then a connection is established, and finally a page is retrieved. It is also likely that subsequent pages will be retrieved from the same host, so a good design will accommodate that mode of use as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start, the
       <code>
        HostRecord
       </code>
       class wraps the functionality of looking up a host. It's an RAII class. Its constructor uses
       <code>
        lookupHostByName()
       </code>
       to perform the lookup. The
       <code>
        unique_ptr
       </code>
       data member uses
       <span aria-label="1221" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1221" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       a custom deleter to automatically free the retrieved
       <code>
        HostHandle
       </code>
       by calling
       <code>
        freeHostHandle()
       </code>
       . See
       <a href="c07.xhtml">
        Chapter 7

       , “Memory Management,” for a discussion of using custom deleters with
       <code>

      <p>
       Next, a
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       class is implemented that uses the
       <code>
        HostRecord
       </code>
       class. The
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       class creates a connection to a given host and supports retrieving webpages. It's also an RAII class. When the
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       object is destroyed, it automatically closes the connection to the host. The
       <code>
        getPage()
       </code>
       member function calls
       <code>
        retrieveWebPage()
       </code>
       and immediately stores the result in a
       <code>
        unique_ptr
       </code>
       with a custom deleter,
       <code>
        freeWebPage()

       The
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       class effectively encapsulates the behavior of a host and provides useful functionality without unnecessary calls and data structures. The implementation of the
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       class makes extensive use of the
       <code>
        networklib
       </code>
       library without exposing any of its workings to the user. The constructor of
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       uses a
       <code>
        HostRecord
       </code>
       RAII object for the specified host. The resulting
       <code>
        HostRecord
       </code>
       is used to set up a connection to the host, which is stored in the
       <code>
        m_connection
       </code>
       data member for later use. The
       <code>
        HostRecord
       </code>
       RAII object is automatically destroyed at the end of the constructor. The
       <code>
        WebHost
       </code>
       destructor destroys
       <code>
        m_connection
       </code>
       which closes the connection. The
       <code>
        getPage()
       </code>
       member function uses
       <code>
        retrieveWebPage()
       </code>
       to retrieve a web page, converts it to an
       <code>
        std::string
       </code>
       , uses
       <code>
        freeWebPage()
       </code>
       to free memory, and returns the retrieved page as an
       <code>
        std::string
       </code>
       .

      <p>
       The
       <code>

       Linking with C Code
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0080">
       The previous example assumed that you had the raw C code to work with. The example took advantage of the fact that most C code will successfully compile with a C++ compiler. If you only have compiled C code, perhaps in the form of a library, you can still use it in your C++ program, but you need to take a few extra steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you can start using compiled C code in your C++ programs, you first need to know about a concept called
       <i>
        name mangling
       </i>
       . To implement function overloading, the complex C++ namespace is “flattened.” For example, if you have a C++ program, it is legitimate to write the following:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0019"><code>void myFunc(double);</code>
<code>void myFunc(int);</code>
<code>void myFunc(int, int);</code></pre>
      <p>
       <span aria-label="1223" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1223" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       However, this would mean that the linker would see several different functions, all called
       <code>
        myFunc
       </code>
       , and would not know which one you want to call. Therefore, all C++ compilers perform an operation that is referred to as
       <i>
        name mangling
       </i>
       and is the logical equivalent of generating names, as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0020"><code>myFunc_double</code>
<code>myFunc_int</code>
<code>myFunc_int_int</code></pre>
      <p>
       To avoid conflicts with other names you might have defined, the compiler might generate names that are reserved as identifiers, for example, names beginning with double underscores or names beginning with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter. Alternatively, some compilers generate names that have characters that are legal to the linker but not legal in C++ source code. For example, Microsoft VC++ generates names as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0021"><code>?myFunc@@YAXN@Z</code>
<code>?myFunc@@YAXH@Z</code>
<code>?myFunc@@YAXHH@Z</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0084">
       This encoding is complex and often vendor specific. The C++ standard does not specify how function overloading should be implemented on a given platform, so there is no standard for name mangling algorithms.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0085">
       In C, function overloading is not supported (the compiler will complain about duplicate definitions). So, names generated by the C compiler are quite simple, for example,
       <code>
        _myFunc
       </code>
       .
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0086">
       Now, if you compile a simple program with the C++ compiler, even if it has only one instance of the
       <code>
        myFunc
       </code>
       name, it still generates a request to link to a mangled name. However, when you link with the C library, it cannot find the desired mangled name, and the linker complains. Therefore, it is necessary to tell the C++ compiler to not mangle that name. This is done by using the
       <code>
        extern "C"
       </code>
       qualification both in the header file (to instruct the client code to create a name compatible with C) and, if your library source is in C++, at the definition site (to instruct the library code to generate a name compatible with C).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the syntax of
       <code>
        extern "C"
       </code>
       :
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0022"><code>extern "C" declaration1();</code>
<code>extern "C" declaration2();</code></pre>
      <p>
       or:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0023"><code>extern "C" {</code>
<code>    declaration1();</code>
<code>    declaration2();</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       The C++ standard says that any language specification can be used, so in principle, the following could be supported by a compiler:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0024"><code>extern "C" void myFunc(int i);</code>
<code>extern "Fortran" Matrix* matrixInvert(Matrix* M);</code>
<code>extern "Pascal" void someLegacySubroutine(int n);</code>
<code>extern "Ada" bool aimMissileDefense(double angle);</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0090">
       In practice, many compilers only support
       <code>
        "C"
       </code>
       . Each compiler vendor will inform you which language designators they support.
      </p>
      <p>
       <span aria-label="1224" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1224" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       As an example, the following code specifies the function prototype for
       <code>
        cFunction()
       </code>
       as an external C function:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0025"><code>extern "C" {</code>
<code>    void cFunction(int i);</code>
<code>}</code>
<code> </code>
<code>int main()</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    cFunction(8); <span class="color3">// Calls the C function.</span></code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0092">
       The actual definition for
       <code>
        cFunction()
       </code>
       is provided in a compiled binary file attached in the link phase. The
       <code>
        extern
       </code>
       keyword informs the compiler that the linked-in code was compiled in C.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more common pattern for using
       <code>
        extern
       </code>
       is at the header level. For example, if you are using a graphics library written in C, it probably came with an
       <code>
        .h
       </code>
       file for you to include. The author of this header file should condition it on whether it is being compiled for C or C++. A C++ compiler predefines the symbol
       <code>
        __cplusplus
       </code>
       if you are compiling for C++. The symbol is not defined for C compilations. This symbol can be used to condition a header file as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0026"><code>#ifdef __cplusplus</code>
<code>    extern "C" {</code>
<code>#endif</code>
<code>        drawCircle();</code>
<code>        drawSquare();</code>
<code>#ifdef __cplusplus</code>
<code>    } <span class="color3">// matches extern "C"</span></code>
<code>#endif</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0094">
       This means that
       <code>
        drawCircle()
       </code>
       and
       <code>
        drawSquare()
       </code>
       are functions that are in a library compiled by the C compiler. Using this technique, the same header file can be used in both C and C++ clients.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0095">
       Whether you are including C code in your C++ program or linking against a compiled C library, remember that even though C++ is almost a superset of C, they are different languages with different design goals. Adapting C code to work in C++ is quite common, but providing an object-oriented C++ wrapper around procedural C code is often much better.

       Calling C++ Code from C#
      </h3>
      <p>
       Even though this is a C++ book, I won't pretend that there aren't other languages out there. One example is C#. By using the
       <i>
        Interop services
       </i>
       from C#, it's pretty easy to call C++ code from within your C# applications. An example scenario could be that you develop parts of your application, like the graphical user interface, in C#, but use C++ to implement certain performance-critical or computational-expensive components. To make Interop work, you need to write a library in C++, which can be called from C#. On Windows, the library will be in a
       <code>
        .dll
       </code>
       file. The following C++ example defines a
       <code>
        functionInDLL()
       </code>
       function that is compiled into a library. The function accepts a Unicode string and returns an integer. The implementation writes the received string to the console and returns the value 42 to the caller:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0027"><code>import std;</code>
<code>using namespace std;</code>
<code> </code>
<span aria-label="1225" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1225" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><code>extern "C"</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    __declspec(dllexport) int functionInDLL(const wchar_t* p)</code>
<code>    {</code>
<code>        wcout &lt;&lt; format(L"The following string was received by C++: '{}'", p)</code>
<code>              &lt;&lt; endl;</code>
<code>        return 42;    <span class="color3">// Return some value…</span></code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0097">
       Keep in mind that you are implementing a function in a library, not writing a program, so you do not need a
       <code>
        main()
       </code>
       function. How you compile this code depends on your development environment. If you are using Microsoft Visual C++, you need to go to the properties of your project and select Dynamic Library (.dll) as the configuration type. The example uses
       <code>
        __declspec(dllexport)
       </code>
       to tell the linker that this function should be made available to clients of the library. This is the way you do it with Microsoft Visual C++. Other linkers might use a different mechanism to export functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have the library, you can call it from C# by using the Interop services. First, you need to include the Interop namespace:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0028"><code>using System.Runtime.InteropServices;</code></pre>
      <p>
       Next, you define the function prototype and tell C# where it can find the implementation of the function. This is done with the following statement, assuming you have compiled the library as
       <code>
        HelloCpp.dll
       </code>
       :
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0029"><code>[DllImport("HelloCpp.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]</code>
<code>public static extern int functionInDLL(String s);</code></pre>
      <p>
       The first line is saying that C# should import this function from a library called
       <code>
        HelloCpp.dll
       </code>
       and that it should use Unicode strings. The second line specifies the actual prototype of the function, which is a function accepting a string as parameter and returning an integer. The following code shows a complete example of how to use the C++ library from C#:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0030"><code>using System;</code>
<code>using System.Runtime.InteropServices;</code>
<code> </code>
<code>namespace HelloCSharp</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    class Program</code>
<code>    {</code>
<code>        [DllImport("HelloCpp.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]</code>
<code>        public static extern int functionInDLL(String s);</code>
<code> </code>
<code>        static void Main(string[] args)</code>
<code>        {</code>
<code>            Console.WriteLine("Written by C#.");</code>
<code>            int result = functionInDLL("Some string from C#.");</code>
<code>            Console.WriteLine("C++ returned the value " + result);</code>
<code>        }</code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       The output is as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0031"><code>Written by C#.</code>
<code>The following string was received by C++: 'Some string from C#.'</code>

       Use C# Code from C++ and C++ from C# with C++/CLI
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0104">
       To use C# code from C++, you can use C++/CLI. CLI stands for
       <i>
        Common Language Infrastructure
       </i>
       and is the backbone of all .NET languages such as C#, Visual Basic .NET, and so on. C++/CLI was created by Microsoft in 2005 to be a version of C++ that supports the CLI. In December 2005, C++/CLI has been standardized as the ECMA-372 standard. You can write your C++ programs in C++/CLI and gain access to any other piece of functionality written in any other language that supports the CLI, such as C#. Keep in mind, though, that C++/CLI might lag behind the latest C++ standard, meaning that it does not necessarily support all latest C++ features. Discussing the C++/CLI language in detail is outside the scope of this pure C++ book. Only a few small examples are given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose you have the following C# class in a C# library:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0032"><code>namespace MyLibrary</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    public class MyClass</code>
<code>    {</code>
<code>        public double DoubleIt(double value) { return value * 2.0; }</code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       You can consume this C# library from your C++/CLI code as follows. The important bits are highlighted. CLI objects are managed by a memory garbage collector that automatically cleans up memory when memory is not needed anymore. As such, you cannot just use the standard C++
       <code>
        new
       </code>
       operator to create managed objects; you have to use
       <code>
        gcnew
       </code>
       , an abbreviation for “garbage collect new.” Instead of storing the resulting pointer in a normal C++ pointer variable such as
       <code>
        MyClass*
       </code>
       or in a smart pointer such as
       <code>
        std::unique_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt;
       </code>
       , you have to store it using a
       <i>
        handle
       </i>
       ,
       <code>
        MyClass^
       </code>
       , usually pronounced as “MyClass hat.”
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0033"><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>
<code> </code>
<code>using namespace System;</code>
<code><b>using namespace MyLibrary;</b></code>
<code> </code>
<code>int main(array&lt;System::String^&gt;^ args)</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    <b>MyClass^ instance { gcnew MyClass() };</b></code>
<code>    <b>auto result { instance-&gt;DoubleIt(1.2) };</b></code>
<code>    std::cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       C++/CLI can also be used in the other direction; you can write managed C++
       <i>
        ref classes
       </i>
       , which are then accessible by any other CLI language. Here is a simple example of a managed C++ ref class:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0034"><code>#pragma once</code>
<span aria-label="1227" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1227" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><code>using namespace System;</code>
<code> </code>
<code>namespace MyCppLibrary</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    <b>public ref class MyCppRefClass</b></code>
<code>    {</code>
<code>        public:</code>
<code>            double TripleIt(double value) { return value * 3.0; }</code>
<code>    };</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       This C++/CLI ref class can then be used from C# as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0035"><code>using MyCppLibrary;</code>
<code> </code>
<code>namespace MyLibrary</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    public class MyClass</code>
<code>    {</code>
<code>        public double TripleIt(double value)</code>
<code>        {</code>
<code>            <span class="color3">// Ask C++ to triple it.</span></code>
<code>            MyCppRefClass cppRefClass = new MyCppRefClass();</code>
<code>            return cppRefClass.TripleIt(value);</code>
<code>        }</code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0109">
       As you can see, the basics are not that complicated, but these examples all use primitive datatypes, such as
       <code>
        double
       </code>
       . It starts to become more complicated if you need to work with non-primitive datatypes such as strings, vectors, and so on, because then you need to start marshaling objects between C# and C++/CLI, and vice versa. However, this would take us too far for this brief introduction to C++/CLI.

       Calling C++ Code from Java with JNI
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0110">
       The
       <i>
        Java Native Interface
       </i>
       (JNI) is part of the Java language that allows programmers to access functionality that was not written in Java. Because Java is a cross-platform language, the original intent was to make it possible for Java programs to interact with the operating system. JNI also allows programmers to make use of libraries written in other languages, such as C++. Access to C++ libraries may be useful to a Java programmer who has a performance-critical or computational-expensive piece of code or who needs to use legacy code.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0111">
       JNI can also be used to execute Java code within a C++ program, but such a use is far less common. Because this is a C++ book, I do not include an introduction to the Java language. This section is recommended if you already know Java and want to incorporate C++ code into your Java code.
      </p>
      <p>
       To begin your Java cross-language adventure, start with the Java program. For this example, the simplest of Java programs will suffice:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0036"><code>public class HelloCpp</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    public static void main(String[] args)</code>
<code>    {</code>
<span aria-label="1228" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1228" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><code>        System.out.println("Hello from Java!");</code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       Next, you need to declare a Java method that will be written in another language. To do this, you use the
       <code>
        native
       </code>
       keyword and leave out the implementation:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0037"><code><span class="color3">// This will be implemented in C++.</span></code>
<code><b>public static native void callCpp();</b></code></pre>
      <p>
       The C++ code will eventually be compiled into a shared library that gets dynamically loaded into the Java program. You can load this library inside a Java static block so that it is loaded when the Java program begins executing. The name of the library can be whatever you want, for example,
       <code>
        hellocpp.so
       </code>
       on Linux systems, or
       <code>
        hellocpp.dll
       </code>
       on Windows systems.
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0038"><code><b>static { System.loadLibrary("hellocpp"); }</b></code></pre>
      <p>
       Finally, you need to actually call the C++ code from within the Java program. The
       <code>
        callCpp()
       </code>
       Java method serves as a placeholder for the not-yet-written C++ code. Here is the complete Java program:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0039"><code>public class HelloCpp</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    static { System.loadLibrary("hellocpp"); }</code>
<code> </code>
<code>    <span class="color3">// This will be implemented in C++.</span></code>
<code>    public static native void callCpp();</code>
<code> </code>
<code>    public static void main(String[] args)</code>
<code>    {</code>
<code>        System.out.println("Hello from Java!");</code>
<code>        <b>callCpp();</b></code>
<code>    }</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       That's all for the Java side. Now, just compile the Java program as you normally would:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0040"><code>javac HelloCpp.java</code></pre>
      <p>
       Then use the
       <code>
        javah
       </code>
       program (I like to pronounce it as
       <i>
        jav-AHH!
       </i>
       ) to create a header file for the native function:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0041"><code>javah HelloCpp</code></pre>
      <p>
       After running
       <code>
        javah
       </code>
       , you will find a file named
       <code>
        HelloCpp.h
       </code>
       , which is a fully working (if somewhat ugly) C/C++ header file. Inside of that header file is a C function definition for a function called
       <code>
        Java_HelloCpp_callCpp()
       </code>
       . Your C++ program will need to implement this function. The full prototype is as follows:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0042"><code>JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_HelloCpp_callCpp(JNIEnv*, jclass);</code></pre>
      <p>
       Your C++ implementation of this function can make full use of the C++ language. This example just outputs some text from C++. First, you need to include the
       <code>
        jni.h
       </code>
       header file and the
       <code>
        HelloCpp.h
       </code>
       file that was created by
       <code>
        javah
       </code>
       . You also need to include any C++ headers that you intend to use.
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0043"><code>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;</code>
<code>#include "HelloCpp.h"</code>
<code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
       <span aria-label="1229" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1229" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       The C++ function is written as normal. The parameters to the function allow interaction with the Java environment and the object that called the native code. They are beyond the scope of this example.
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0044"><code>JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_HelloCpp_callCpp(JNIEnv*, jclass)</code>
<code>{</code>
<code>    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello from C++!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code>
<code>}</code></pre>
      <p>
       How to compile this code into a library depends on your environment, but you will most likely need to tweak your compiler's settings to include the JNI headers. Using the GCC compiler on Linux, your compile command might look like this:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0045"><code>g++ -shared -I/usr/java/jdk/include/ -I/usr/java/jdk/include/linux \</code>
<code>HelloCpp.cpp -o hellocpp.so</code></pre>
      <p>
       The output from the compiler is the library used by the Java program. As long as the shared library is somewhere in the Java class path, you can execute the Java program as you normally would:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0046"><code>java HelloCpp</code></pre>
      <p>
       You should see the following result:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0047"><code>Hello from Java!</code>
<code>Hello from C++!</code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0124">
       Of course, this example just scratches the surface of what is possible through JNI. You could use JNI to interface with OS-specific features or hardware drivers. For complete coverage of JNI, you should consult a Java text.

       Calling Scripts from C++ Code
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0125">
       The original Unix OS included a rather limited C library, which did not support certain common operations. Unix programmers therefore developed the habit of launching
       <i>
        scripts
       </i>
       from applications to accomplish tasks that should have had API or library support. Scripts can be written in languages such as Perl and Python, but they can also be shell scripts for executing in a shell such as Bash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, many of these Unix programmers still insist on using scripts as a form of subroutine call. To enable these kinds of interoperabilities, C++ provides the
       <code>
        std::system()
       </code>
       function defined in
       <code>
        &lt;cstdlib&gt;
       </code>
       . It requires only a single argument, a string representing the command you want to execute. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <pre id="c34-code-0048"><code>system("python my_python_script.py");  <span class="color3">// Launch a Python script.</span></code>
<code>system("perl my_perl_script.pl");      <span class="color3">// Launch a Perl script.</span></code>
<code>system("my_shell_script.sh");          <span class="color3">// Launch a Shell script.</span></code></pre>
      <p id="c34-para-0127">
       However, there are significant risks to this approach. For example, if there is an error in the script, the caller may or may not get a detailed error indication. The
       <code>
        system()
       </code>
       call is also exceptionally heavy-duty, because it has to create an entire new process to execute the script. This may ultimately be a serious performance bottleneck in your application.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0128">
       Using
       <code>
        system()
       </code>
       to launch scripts is not further discussed in this text. In general, you should explore the features of C++ libraries to see if there are better ways to do something. There are some platform-independent wrappers around a lot of platform-specific libraries, for example, the Boost Asio library,
       <span aria-label="1230" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_1230" role="doc-pagebreak">
       </span>
       which provides portable networking and other low-level I/O, including sockets, timers, serial ports, and so on. If you need to work with a filesystem, you can use the platform-independent
       <code>
        &lt;filesystem&gt;
       </code>
       API available as part of the C++ Standard Library since C++17, and discussed in
       <a href="c13.xhtml">
        Chapter 13
       </a>
       . Concepts like launching a Perl script with
       <code>
        system()
       </code>
       to process some textual data may not be the best choice. Using techniques like the regular expressions library of C++, see
       <a href="c21.xhtml">
        Chapter 21
       </a>
       , “String Localization and Regular Expressions,” might be a better choice for your string processing needs.

       Calling C++ Code from Scripts
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0129">
       C++ contains a built-in general-purpose mechanism to interface with other languages and environments. You've already used it many times, probably without paying much attention to it—it's the arguments to and return value from the
       <code>
        main()

       function.

       C and C++ were designed with command-line interfaces in mind. The
       <code>
        main()
       </code>
       function receives the arguments from the command line and returns a status code that can be interpreted by the caller. In a scripting environment, arguments to and status codes from your program can be a powerful mechanism that allows you to interface with the environment.

        A Practical Example: Encrypting Passwords
       </h4>
       <p>
        Assume that you have a system that writes everything a user sees and types to a file for auditing purposes. The file can be read only by the system administrator so that she can figure out who to blame if something goes wrong. An excerpt of such a file might look like this:
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0049"><code>Login: bucky-bo</code>
<code>Password: feldspar</code>
<code> </code>
<code>bucky-bo &gt; mail</code>
<code>bucky-bo has no mail</code>
<code>bucky-bo &gt; exit</code></pre>
       <p id="c34-para-0132">
        While the system administrator may want to keep a log of all user activity, she may also want to obscure everybody's passwords in case the file is somehow obtained by a hacker. She decides to write a script to parse the log files and to use C++ to perform the actual encryption. The script then calls out to a C++ program to perform the encryption.
       </p>
       <p>
        The following script uses the Perl language, though almost any scripting language could accomplish this task. Note also that these days, there are libraries available for Perl that perform encryption, but, for the sake of this example, let's assume the encryption is done in C++. If you don't know Perl, you will still be able to follow along. The most important element of the Perl syntax for this example is the
        <code>
         `
        </code>
        character. The
        <code>
         `
        </code>
        character instructs the Perl script to
        <i>
         shell out
        </i>
        to an external command. In this case, the script will shell out to a C++ program called
        <code>
         encryptString
        </code>
        .

        The strategy for the script is to loop over every line of a file,
        <code>
         userlog.txt
        </code>
        , looking for lines that contain a password prompt. The script writes a new file,
        <code>
         userlog.out
        </code>
        , which contains the same text as the source file, except that all passwords are encrypted. The first step is to open the input file for reading and the output file for writing. Then, the script needs to loop over all the lines in the file. Each line in turn is placed in a variable called
        <code>
         $line
        </code>
        .
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0050"><code>open (INPUT, "userlog.txt") or die "Couldn't open input file!";</code>
<code>open (OUTPUT, "&gt;userlog.out") or die "Couldn't open output file!";</code>
<code>while ($line = &lt;INPUT&gt;) {</code></pre>
       <p>
        Next, the current line is checked against a
        <i>
         regular expression
        </i>
        to see if this particular line contains the
        <code>
         Password:
        </code>
        prompt. If it does, Perl stores the password in the variable
        <code>
         $1
        </code>
        .
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0051"><code>    if ($line =˜ m/^Password: (.*)/) {</code></pre>
       <p>
        If a match is found, the script calls the
        <code>
         encryptString
        </code>
        program with the detected password to obtain an encrypted version of it. The output of the program is stored in the
        <code>
         $result
        </code>
        variable, and the result status code from the program is stored in the variable
        <code>
         $?
        </code>
        . The script checks
        <code>
         $?
        </code>
        and quits immediately if there is a problem. If everything is okay, the password line is written to the output file with the encrypted password instead of the original one.
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0052"><code>        $result = `./encryptString $1`;</code>
<code>        if ($? != 0) { exit(-1); }</code>
<code>        print OUTPUT "Password: $result\n";</code>
<code>    } else {</code></pre>
       <p>
        If the current line is not a password prompt, the script writes the line as is to the output file. At the end of the loop, it closes both files and exits.
       </p>
       <pre id="c34-code-0053"><code>        print OUTPUT "$line";</code>

        <code>

        through
        <code>

        Now that you've seen how easily C++ programs can be incorporated into scripting languages, you can combine the strengths of the two languages for your own projects. You can use a scripting language to interact with the operating system and control the flow of the script, and a traditional programming language like C++ for the heavy lifting.

       Calling Assembly Code from C++
      </h3>
      <p id="c34-para-0146">
       C++ is considered a fast language, especially relative to other languages. Yet, in some rare cases, you might want to use raw assembly code when speed is absolutely critical. The compiler generates assembly code from your source files, and this generated assembly code is fast enough for virtually all purposes. Both the compiler and the linker (when it supports link time code generation) use optimization algorithms to make the generated assembly code as fast as possible. These optimizers are getting more and more powerful by using special processor instruction sets such as MMX, SSE, and AVX. These days, it's hard to write your own assembly code that outperforms the code generated by the compiler, unless you know all the little details of these enhanced instruction sets.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0147">
       However, in case you do need it, the keyword
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       can be used by a C++ compiler to allow the programmer to insert raw assembly code. The keyword is part of the C++ standard, but its implementation is compiler-defined. In some compilers, you can use
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       to drop from C++ down to the level of assembly right in the middle of your program. Sometimes, the support for the
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       keyword depends on your target architecture, and sometimes a compiler uses a non-standard keyword instead of the
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       keyword. For example, Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 does not support the
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       keyword. Instead, it supports the
       <code>
        __asm
       </code>
       keyword when compiling in 32-bit mode, and does not support inline assembly at all when compiling in 64-bit mode.

       Assembly code can be useful in some applications, but I don't recommend it for most programs. There are several reasons to avoid assembly code:

      <ul class="check1" id="c34-list-0003">

        Most programmers don't know assembly languages and won't be able to modify or maintain your code.

        Most of the time, it is not necessary. If your program is slow, look for algorithmic problems, or consult some of the other performance suggestions from

           When you encounter performance issues in your application, use a profiler to determine the real hotspot, and look into algorithmic speed-ups!

       Practically, if you have a computationally expensive block of code, you should move it to its own C++ function. If you determine, using performance profiling (see
       <a href="c29.xhtml">
        Chapter 29
       </a>
       ), that this function is a performance bottleneck, and there is no way to write the code smaller and faster, you might use raw assembly code to try to increase its performance.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0151">
       In such a case, one of the first things you want to do is declare the function
       <code>
        extern "C"
       </code>
       so the C++ name mangling is suppressed. Then, you can write a separate module in assembly code that performs the function more efficiently. The advantage of a separate module is that there is both a “reference implementation” in C++ that is platform-independent, and also a platform-specific high-performance implementation in raw assembly code. The use of
       <code>
        extern "C"
       </code>
       means that the assembly code can use a simple naming convention (otherwise, you have to reverse-engineer your compiler's name mangling algorithm). Then, you can link with either the C++ version or the assembly code version.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0152">
       You would write this module in assembly code and run it through an assembler, rather than using the inline
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       keyword in C++. This is particularly true in many of the popular x86-compatible 64-bit compilers, where the inline
       <code>
        asm
       </code>
       keyword is not supported.
      </p>
      <p id="c34-para-0153">
       Even though it is possible, you should use raw assembly code only if there are significant performance improvements. Additionally, don't forget
       <i>
        Amdahl's law
       </i>
       . For example, a 10x speedup in your encryption routine sounds great, but if your program spends 90 percent of its time not doing encryption, that means that 10x speedup is for 10 percent of the program only—just a 9 percent overall improvement!

      If you take away one point from this chapter, it should be that C++ is a flexible language. It exists in the sweet spot between languages that are too tied to a particular platform, and languages that are

        The networking example in the Shifting Paradigms section showing how to use a C-style API with C++ might be a bit abstract. It doesn't present an entire implementation as that would require networking code which is neither provided by the C nor the C++ Standard Library. In this exercise, let's look at a much smaller C-style library that you might want to use in your C++ code. The C-style library basically consists of two functions. The first function,
        <code>
         reverseString()
        </code>
        , allocates a new string and initializes it with the reverse of a given source string. The second function,
        <code>
         freeString()
        </code>
        , frees the memory allocated by
        <code>
         reverseString()
