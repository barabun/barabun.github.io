      Foreword
     </h1>
     <div class="para_fl" id="p0010">
      I should begin by confessing that I do not consider myself a world-class application programming interface (API) designer or software engineer. I do, however, consider myself an expert researcher in the areas of computer graphics and geometric modeling. It was in this line of work that I first met Martin at Pixar Animation Studios.

     <div class="para_indented" id="p0015">
      As a graphics researcher I was accustomed to writing mathematically sophisticated papers. I was also formally trained as a computer scientist at a major university and had written my share of code. Armed with this background, when I was presented with the opportunity to lead a group of software engineers working on a new generation of animation software for Pixar, I figured that it couldn't be any more difficult than research. After all, research is, by definition, the creation of the unknown, whereas engineering is the implementation of well-understood subjects. I could not have been more wrong.
     </div>
     <div class="para_indented" id="p0020">
      I came to realize that software engineering was without a doubt the most difficult challenge I had ever confronted. After more years than I care to admit, I eventually gave up and went back to graphics research.

      I can't tell you how much I would have benefitted from a book like API Design for C++. Many of the lessons we learned the hard way have been captured by Martin in this insightful, easy to use book. Martin approaches the subject not from the perspective of an academic software researcher (although he draws heavily from results and insights gained there), but from the perspective of an in-the-trenches software engineer and manager. He has experienced firsthand the importance of good software design and has emerged as an articulate voice of what good means. In this book he presents effective strategies for achieving that goal.
     </div>
     <div class="para_indented" id="p0030">
      I particularly like that Martin is not focusing just on API design, but more broadly on software life cycles, allowing him to cover topics such as versioning, strategies for backward compatibility, and branching methodologies.
     </div>
     <div class="para_indented" id="p0035">
      In short, this book should be of great value to those creating or managing software activities. It is a comprehensive collection of best practices that have proven themselves time and time again.
